Note: Good name is hard, some of these are telescopes. Surveys will go into "catalogs"

## NICER


## SWIFT


## HST


## JWST


## ALMA


## ACT


## EHT


## LIGO
Why are GW sensitivity curves V-shaped? 

Rate goes with range cubed -> rate ~ volume we can probe. 2x more instrument sensitivity means can detect same events from a volume 8x bigger in the universe.


## VIRGO


## KAGRA


## LBT


## Magellan


## GMT
"Giant Magellan Telescope". Successor to [[#Magellan]]. 


## CHANDRA
**ACIS**: Camera on CHANDRA, PI Mark Bautz here at MKI


## XRISM


## GAIA


## KECK


## VLT


## Subaru


## Gemini


## LAMOST


## ELT
"Extremely large telescope"


## Vera C. Rubin Observatory


## LSST
Telesope hosted at the [[#Vera C. Rubin Observatory]] 


## Kepler


## 30m telescope


## UTRAO
"University of Texas Radio Astronomy Observatory". 


## SITELLE
Maybe a catalog?


## Lynx
X-ray


## Athena
X-ray


## AXIS
X-ray


## Hitomi


## Deep space network
NASA facility for the retrieval of signals from deep space telescopes. Consists of three facilities spaced equidistant from each other – approximately 120 degrees apart in longitude – around the world. These sites are near Goldstone, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia.


## Green bank telescope


## NANOGrav
Collaboration to measure low-frequency gravitational wave universe through radio pulsar timing. USe [[#Green bank telescope]].  


## Cosmic explorer


## XMM
"XMM-Newton", "X-ray multi-mirror"


## eRosita
Half of the data unavilable due to Russian invasion of Ukraine.


## BOSS


## WISE
"Wide-field infrared survey explorer". Launched in 2009, later renamed to "NEOWISE" for "near-Earth orbit WISE". All-sky survey.

**Band**: IR at $3-20\,\pu{\mu m}$ 


## CHIME



## CHORD
