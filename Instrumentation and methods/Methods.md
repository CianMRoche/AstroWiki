## Space-based detector orbits
**Lagrange points** - JWST

**Low Earth orbit** - HITOMI XRISM SWIFT NuSTAR AMS (on ISS)

**Lunar resonsance** - TESS

**High Earth orbit** - Chandra XMM


## Telemetry
The recording and communication of information from the instrument to us. In the context of space-based observatories, refers to returning the data to Earth via a retrieval mechanism like the [[Observatories#Deep space network|deep space network]].


## Long baseline interferometry
Using multiple detectors, one can increase the effective resolution to an instrument of the same size as the separation between detectors (but with less light collection area). 

The image below shows that detectors aligned colinearly improve the resolution along that axis (variation in that dimension of the image happens more quickly than orthogonal direction). Need to use at least a triangle if you want details in both dimensions
