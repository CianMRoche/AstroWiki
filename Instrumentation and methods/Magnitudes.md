## Apparent magnitude
A measure of "how much flux do we observe from a thing", scales oddly so <mark class="hltr-pink">low magnitudes mean bright things</mark>. Apparent magnitude differences due to differences in observed [[Units#Flux|flux]] $F$ are given by $$\Delta m = m_1 - m_2 = -2.5\log _{10}\left(\frac{F_1}{F_2}\right)$$If observing with a filter $X$ (such as the passbands in the [[#UBVRI]] system) which has reference point "zero-point" flux $F_{X,0}$ then the apparent magnitude in that filter is $$m_X = -2.5\log _{10}\left(\frac{F_X}{F_{X,0}}\right)$$This also implies that the magnitude will change depending on your chosen zero-points. This is the issue of choosing a magnitude system, an example of which is the Vega magnitude system which places the star Vega at magnitude 0 in all bands (but the spedctral energy density of Vega isnt flat so this makes for a weird magnitude system). AB magnitude system makes a bit more sense.

## Absolute magnitude


## Photographic magnitude
A measure of the relative brightness of a star or other astronomical object as imaged on a <mark class="hltr-grey">photographic film emulsion</mark> with a camera attached to a telescope. Has since been superseded by [[Electronics#CCD|CCD]] photometry and alternative magnitude systems such as [[#UBVRI]]
