## OII doublet
Traces cool, ionized gas. Has been used to trace [[Object Types#CGM|CGM]]. Ratio of two lines depends on the temperature


## H$\alpha$
Emmitted only by molecular Hydrogen. H doesnt have a rotational dipole, only a vibrational. Finding H2 was usually done by measuring CO with millimeter telescopes and then constraining the CO H2 correllation. Now with JWST this can be done better, since we have a mid IR IFU in space. 


## P Cygni Line Profile
Spectroscopic feature with both a blueshifted absorption line and a broadened rest wavelength emission line arising from an expanding envelope around an ionized source
