## Hertzsprung-Russel diagram
This diagram demonstrates the clustering between the [[HarvardSpectralClassification.png|color]] (temperature) of stars to their intrinsic luminosity ([[Magnitudes#Absolute magnitude|absolute magnitude]])

## Main sequence
A line (and thus, evolutionary track) that can be identified on the [[#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram]] which comprises ~90% of known stars, including the [[Objects#The Sun|Sun]]. 


## OII doublet
Traces cool, ionized gas. Has been used to trace [[Object Types#CGM|CGM]]. Ratio of two lines depends on the temperature


## H$\alpha$
Emmitted only by molecular Hydrogen. H doesnt have a rotational dipole, only a vibrational. Finding H2 was usually done by measuring CO with millimeter telescopes and then constraining the CO H2 correllation. Now with JWST this can be done better, since we have a mid IR IFU in space. 


## P Cygni Line Profile
Spectroscopic feature with both a blueshifted absorption line and a broadened rest wavelength emission line arising from an expanding envelope around an ionized source

## Harvard Spectral Classification
- Classifies stars into spectral type based on temperature 
- Originally classes A-Q based on strength of hydrogen lines in spectra, but found that there was lots of overlap amongst categories (and also they were in the wrong order for other properties)
- Cannot distinguish between same color, same apparent magnitude, but different luminosity stars (need [[Spectra#Morgan-Keenan (MK or MKK) Luminosity Class|MK Luminosity Classification]])

- Oh Be A Fine Goat Kick Me (OBAFGKM). Note the hydrogen line strength is a gaussian at "A", mass, radius and lunimosity all decrease, and fraction of [[#Main sequence]] stars increases.

## Morgan-Keenan (MK or MKK) Luminosity Class
Stellar classification based on spectral line widths to distinguish between stars with the same color/temperature and apparent magnitude, but different luminosities/distances
- denser objects have broader spectral lines due to increased pressure/collisional broadening and higher surface gravity
- complementary to [[Spectra#Harvard Spectral Classification|Harvard Spectral Classification]]
