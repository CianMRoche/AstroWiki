## Galaxy cluster
A gravitationally bound collection of <mark class="hltr-grey">hundreds to thousands</mark> of galaxies. 2nd largest gravitationally-bound structure in the universe after cosmic filaments. Bigger than a [[#Galaxy group|galaxy group]].

**Composition**: (percentages of mass)
- Galaxies 1%
- [[#Intracluster medium]] 9%
- Dark matter 90%

**Typical parameters**:
- $10^2$ to $10^3$ member galaxies
- Mass: $10^{14}-10^{15}$ $M_\odot$ 
- Diameter: 1-5 Mpc

**Examples**:
- Virgo cluster
- Noma cluster
- Pheonix cluster
- Bullet cluster
- [[Objects#Perseus cluster|Perseus cluster]]


## Brightest cluster galaxy
Largest/brightest galaxy in a [[#Galaxy cluster]]
Large amount of X-ray emission

**Observation strategies**:
- Can observe molecular gas emission, but need ~$10^8\,M_\odot$ of stellar mass to observe this confidently (can do with [[Observatories#ALMA|ALMA]])
- Molecular absorption of AGN backlight in radio to probe mass scales of ~10s to 100s of $M_\odot$ since very strong absorption lines from CO, HCO$^+$, HNC, H$_2$CO and SiO. Width of absorption feature increases with velocity dispersion -> proximity to [[#AGN]]'s supermassive black hole. Does require presence and alignment of BCG disk with AGN


## Galaxy group
A gravitationally bound collection of <mark class="hltr-grey">50 or fewer</mark> galaxies, each at least as luminous as the Milky Way (~$10^{10}\, L_\odot$). Smaller than a [[#Galaxy cluster|galaxy cluster]] at about $10^{13}\, M_\odot$. The [[Objects#Milky way|Milky Way]] is part of a galaxy group called the [[Objects#Local group|local group]].

The first discovered galaxy group was [[Objects#Stephan's quintet|Stephan's quintet]]

**Typical parameters**:
- $<50$ member galaxies
- Mass: ~$10^{13}$ $M_\odot$ 
- Diameter: 1-2 Mpc


## Subdwarf O star
A <mark class="hltr-cyan">low mass, evolved star</mark>, hot enough to produce HeII lines

**Typical parameter**s: 
- $T_{eff}$ = 37000 − 55000 K
- $\log g$ = 5.5 − 6
- $L$ = 20 − 100 $L_\odot$

**Examples**:
- [[Catalogs#Henry Draper|HD]] 128220


## Blue straggler
Michael told me to look this one up. Havent done that yet.


## Quasar
A highly luminous [[#AGN]]. AKA "QSO" (quasi-stellar object)

**Catalogs**: [[Catalogs#SDSS|SDSS]] and [[Catalogs#LAMOST|LAMOST]] 


## Blazar
A [[#Quasar|quasar]] with a relativistic jet pointing along out line of sight


## Collapsar


## AGN
A compact region in a galactic center with high luminosity not produced by stars. This luminosity is theorized to arise from accretion onto a supermassive [[#Black Hole|black hole]] at the center of the galaxy.

Cold [[#Molecular cloud|molecular gas]] falls onto the AGN (from [[#Brightest cluster galaxy|BCG]] usually) and fuels jets, lobes and feedback

**Feedback**: 
- Accretion onto BH -> Jets -> Bubbles -> ICM.
- Early stage is supersonic expansion until the movement of the bubble itself becomes faster than the expansion, then detachment of bubble. Enough energy in bubbles to balance radiative cooling


## Black hole
A region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon


## Interstellar medium



## CGM
"Circumgalactic medium". 
**Observation strategies**:
1. Observing a [[#Quasar|quasar]] behind the CGM and analysing the CGM's impact on the spectrum of the quasar.
	**Advantages**: does not depend on host galaxy's luminosity or redshift
	**Disadvantages**: Must have quasar behind
  
2. "Down the barrel spectroscopy" Observing the host galaxy's spectrum through the CGM 
	**Advantages**: Probes innermost radii 
	**Disadvantages**: depends on galaxy's flux though, lose radial position information

3. Spectroscopic cube around the host galaxy 
	**Advantages**: great spatial info
	**Disadvantages**: highly eroded by redshift, and requires dense, hot gas


## Nebula
A luminescent, diffuse part of the [[Object Types#Interstellar medium|interstellar medium]], often star-forming regions. 

**Consist of**: 
- ionized, neutral or [[Spectra#Molecular hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]] 
- cosmic [[#Dust|dust]]
- Particle density ~$10^{4}\,\pu{cm^{-3}}$ ([[Objects#Earth|Earth]] has ~$10^{19}\,\pu{cm^{-3}}$)

**Examples**:
- Eagle nebula (star-forming Pillars of Creation within)
- Crab nebula
- Orion nebula (brightest nebula)
- Carina nebula


## Planetary nebula
An emission nebula from the outer layers of a dying intermediate mass ($0.8 M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 8 M_\odot$) star as the outer envelope expands away after the AGB phase
- envelope lost from strong stellar winds in AGB phase


## Emission nebula
A [[#Nebula|nebula]] formed of ionized gas emitting in various wavelengths 


## Reflection nebula


## <mark class="hltr-orange">Pulsar</mark>
- PULSAting Radio source
- highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits EM radiation out of its magnetic poles
- [[Spectra#RadioSource|Radio source]] (galactic and extragalactic)


## Neutron stars

- Do we have a good idea for what the mass evolution looks like? Maybe no?
- We dont see lots of neutron star merger/collisions? Neutron stars dont have enough mass to dynamically "sink" to the center as black holes do. We expect BHs to merge in centers of galaxies but NSs to stay "out" and therefore have a lower chance of intercating


## Dust


## Open cluster
A group of 10s to 1000s of stars formed from the same giant [[#Molecular cloud|cloud of molecular gas]] and thus have similar metallic properties, which is weakly gravitationally bound enough that they can be disrupted by close encounters with other clusters or clouds of gas. Less tightly bound than [[#Globular cluster|globular clusters]]. 


## Molecular cloud
AKA "stellar nursery" if stars are forming. A cloud of mostly [[Spectra#Molecular hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]] (since hot gas cools to molecular gas, can then form stars) and dust, called a "dark nebula" if enough dust and dense enough to block visible light from background sources like stars, emission nebulae or reflection nebulae. Very filamentary and chaotic-looking structure, which arises from a combination of gravitational collapse and [[Processes#Turbulence|turbulence]] (large scale).

These comprise less than 1% of the [[#Interstellar medium]] 


## Globular Cluster
- gravitationally bound spheroidal conglomeration of (10,000-few million) stars 
- higher concentration of stars toward center
