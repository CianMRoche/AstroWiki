## Galaxy cluster
A gravitationally bound collection of <mark class="hltr-grey">hundreds to thousands</mark> of galaxies. 2nd largest gravitationally-bound structure in the universe after cosmic filaments. Bigger than a [[#Galaxy group|galaxy group]].

**Composition**: (percentages of mass)
- Galaxies 1%
- [[#Intracluster medium]] 9%
- Dark matter 90%
**Typical parameters**:
- $10^2$ to $10^3$ member galaxies
- Mass: $10^{14}-10^{15}$ $M_\odot$ 
- Diameter: 1-5 Mpc

**Examples**:
- Virgo cluster
- Noma cluster
- Pheonix cluster
- Bullet cluster
- [[Objects#Perseus cluster|Perseus cluster]]


## Galaxy group
A gravitationally bound collection of <mark class="hltr-grey">50 or fewer</mark> galaxies, each at least as luminous as the Milky Way (~$10^{10}\, L_\odot$). Smaller than a [[#Galaxy cluster|galaxy cluster]] at about $10^{13}\, M_\odot$. The [[Objects#Milky way|Milky Way]] is part of a galaxy group called the [[Objects#Local group|local group]].

The first discovered galaxy group was [[Objects#Stephan's quintet|Stephan's quintet]]

**Typical parameters**:
- $<50$ member galaxies
- Mass: ~$10^{13}$ $M_\odot$ 
- Diameter: 1-2 Mpc


## Subdwarf O star
A <mark class="hltr-cyan">low mass, evolved star</mark>, hot enough to produce HeII lines

**Typical parameter**s: 
- $T_{eff}$ = 37000 − 55000 K
- $\log g$ = 5.5 − 6
- $L$ = 20 − 100 $L_\odot$

**Examples**:
- [[Catalogs#Henry Draper catalogue|HD]] 128220


## Blue straggler
Michael told me to look this one up. Havent done that yet.


## Quasar
A highly luminous [[#AGN]]. AKA "QSO" (quasi-stellar object)

**Catalogs**: [[Catalogs#SDSS|SDSS]] and [[Catalogs#LAMOST|LAMOST]] 


## Blazar
A [[#Quasar|quasar]] with a relativistic jet pointing along out line of sight


## Collapsar


## AGN
A compact region in a galactic center with high luminosity not produced by stars. This luminosity is theorized to arise from accretion onto a supermassive [[#Black Hole|black hole]] at the center of the galaxy.


## Black hole
A region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon


## CGM
"Circumgalactic medium". 
**Observation strategies**:
1. Observing a [[#Quasar|quasar]] behind the CGM and analysing the CGM's impact on the spectrum of the quasar.
	**Advantages**: does not depend on host galaxy's luminosity or redshift
	**Disadvantages**: Must have quasar behind
  
2. "Down the barrel spectroscopy" Observing the host galaxy's spectrum through the CGM 
	**Advantages**: Probes innermost radii 
	**Disadvantages**: depends on galaxy's flux though, lose radial position information

3. Spectroscopic cube around the host galaxy 
	**Advantages**: great spatial info
	**Disadvantages**: highly eroded by redshift, and requires dense, hot gas


## Planetary Nebula
An emission nebula from the outer layers of a dying intermediate mass ($0.8 M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 8 M_\odot$) star as the outer envelope expands away after the AGB phase
- envelope lost from strong stellar winds in AGB phase
