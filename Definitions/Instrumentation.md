## MOSFET
"Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor". Voltage across gate determines conductivity, effectively forming a non-mechanical switch which is controlled electronically.


## CCD
"Charge Coupled Device". An integrated circuit used for high-quality industrial and scientific photographic imaging, in which <mark class="hltr-grey">pixels are represented by individual capacitors</mark> covered by a photoactive material (silicon). Each capacitor in the array can exchange charge with neighboring capacitors, which allows the signal in one pixel to travel to a charge amplifier, converting the signal from a pixel into a voltage.

The quality advantage of CCDs over [[#CMOS]] sensors has diminished in recent years. Both are based on metal oxide semiconductor technology (CCDs on MOS capacitors, and CMOS on [[#MOSFET]] amplifiers).


## CMOS 
"Active pixel sensor / complementary [[#MOSFET|MOS(FET)]]". 


## Space-based detector orbits
**Lagrange points** - JWST

**Low Earth orbit** - HITOMI XRISM SWIFT NuSTAR AMS (on ISS)

**Lunar resonsance** - TESS

**High Earth orbit** - Chandra XMM


## Telemetry
The recording and communication of information from the instrument to us. In the context of space-based observatories, refers to returning the data to Earth via a retrieval mechanism like the [[#Deep space network]]


## Deep space network
NASA facility for the retrieval of signals from deep space telescopes. Consists of three facilities spaced equidistant from each other – approximately 120 degrees apart in longitude – around the world. These sites are near Goldstone, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia.


## Long baseline interferometry
Using multiple detectors, one can increase the effective resolution to an instrument of the same size as the separation between detectors (but with less light collection area). 

The image below shows that detectors aligned colinearly improve the resolution along that axis (variation in that dimension of the image happens more quickly than orthogonal direction). Need to use at least a triangle if you want details in both dimensions
