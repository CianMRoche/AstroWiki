## MOSFET
"Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor". Voltage across gate determines conductivity, effectively forming a non-mechanical switch which is controlled electronically.


## CCD
"Charge Coupled Device". An integrated circuit used for high-quality industrial and scientific photographic imaging, in which <mark class="hltr-grey">pixels are represented by individual capacitors</mark> covered by a photoactive material (silicon). Each capacitor in the array can exchange charge with neighboring capacitors, which allows the signal in one pixel to travel to a charge amplifier, converting the signal from a pixel into a voltage.

The quality advantage of CCDs over [[#CMOS]] sensors has diminished in recent years. Both are based on metal oxide semiconductor technology (CCDs on MOS capacitors, and CMOS on [[#MOSFET]] amplifiers).
