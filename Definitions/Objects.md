## Subdwarf O star
A <mark class="hltr-cyan">low mass, evolved star</mark>, hot enough to produce HeII lines

**Typical parameter**s: 
- $T_{eff}$ = 37000 − 55000 K
- $\log g$ = 5.5 − 6
- $L$ = 20 − 100 $L_\odot$

## Blue Straggler


## Quasar
A highly luminous [[#AGN]] 


## AGN
A compact region in a galactic center with high luminosity not produced by stars. This luminosity is theorized to arise from accretion onto a supermassive [[#Black Hole|black hole]] at the center of the galaxy.


## Black Hole
A region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon
