AKA "Braking radiation". Electromagnetic radiation produced by the deceleration of a charged particle when deflected by another charged particle, typically an electron by an atomic nucleus.

- Free-free: emission from a plasma, since both particles are unbound both before and after collision. Emits a continuous spectrum
