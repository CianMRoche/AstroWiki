Here lives questions that need to be asked in order to make notes better

- [[Objects#Perseus cluster]] seems small but also has lots of galaxies, is it just super dense?
- When to use ideal gas law for stars instead of polytope or something else?
- Why does most of the kinetic energy in a relativistic plasma go into the electrons (lighter species)?
