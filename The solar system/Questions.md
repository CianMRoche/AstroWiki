#### 1. (a) Describe, qualitatively, the standard model for the formation of the solar system, and discuss observational evidence for this model. 
- Formed by gravitational collapse of gaseous [[Nebulae|nebula]] 
- Conservation of angular momentum $\implies$ radius of cloud decreases, spins up, makes accretion disk

#### 1. (b) Describe observations of exoplanets that have challenged this simple picture as a universal explanation for planet formation
