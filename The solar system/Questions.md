#### 1. (a) Describe, qualitatively, the standard model for the formation of the solar system, and discuss observational evidence for this model. 
1. Gravitational collapse of gaseous [[Nebulae|nebula]] 
	- Conservation of angular momentum $\implies$ as radius of cloud decreases, spins up, forms [[Accretion#Accretion disk|accretion disk]] 
2. Hot dense, [[Stellar classes#Protostar|protostar]] forms. See [[Star formation]] for details.
3. Planetesimals (~$10\,\pu{km}$) form via collisions of small dust ($1\,\pu{\mu m}$ - $1\,\pu{cm}$), rocks and ices. Type of planetesimal formed depends on composition of material and therefore the temperature in the disk at that location. 
	- Eg. every element has an **ice line**, the radius at which volatiles of that element can condense into ice grains (for water, about 3 AU). Volatiles are easily vaporized things like $\rm{H_2O}$, $\rm{CO_2}$ and $\rm{NH_3}$ (ammonia)
	- Ice giants form after this line, rocky planets form before this line (closer to star)
4. Moons form via each planetesimal forming its own accretion disk 
5. Remnant material craters planets and moons
6. Disk is not exactly Keplerian due to pressure gradient, so things drift toward star 
	- Problem: timescale is short relative to formation and growth times. How do they survive? Pressure fluctuates and local pressure maxima allow for more growth
7. Once large enough, rocky cores accumulate a gas envelope, becoming a **gas giant**. Within the ice


#### 1. (b) Describe observations of exoplanets that have challenged this simple picture as a universal explanation for planet formation
