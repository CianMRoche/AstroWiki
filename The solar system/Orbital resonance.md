## Orbital resonance
Just watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyn64b4LNJ0) since its a very good explanation of mean orbital resonance

Note: at about 15 minutes when he says "and thats why there are gaps in orbits of Saturns rings / asteroid belt" the explanation might be because it encourages lots of objects into that area, increasing collision rates and sending objects off into other, perturbed orbits? And in fact there are some objects there but they just regularly get kicked out in a way that does not happen off resonance? Not sure about that point
