## Protoplanetary disk
A rotating circumstellar disc of dense gas and [[Dust#Dust|dust]] surrounding a young star. 


## Ram pressure
Ram pressure is a pressure exerted on a body moving through a fluid medium, caused by relative bulk motion of the fluid rather than random thermal motion (without viscosity, the stress tensor is isotropic termal pressure + ram presure). It causes a drag force to be exerted on the body via the pressure $$P_{\rm{ram}} = \rho v^2$$ in the simplest case where the momentum is fully transferred to the object
