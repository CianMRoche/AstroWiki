## Protoplanetary disk
A rotating circumstellar disc of dense gas and [[Dust#Dust|dust]] surrounding a young star. 


## Ram pressure
Ram pressure is a pressure exerted on a body moving through a fluid medium, caused by relative bulk motion of the fluid rather than random thermal motion (without viscosity, the stress tensor is isotropic termal pressure + ram presure). It causes a drag force to be exerted on the body via the pressure $$P_{\rm{ram}} = \rho v^2$$ in the simplest case where the momentum is fully transferred to the object


## Kozai mechanism
Perturbation of a binary system by a third object which results in a periodic exchange between the binary orbit's eccentricity and inclination


## Asteroid
An asteroid is a small, rocky object and when seen in a telescope, it appears as a point of light. Most asteroids are found in a ring between the orbit of Mars and Jupiter called the asteroid belt.

Some asteroids are round, some are elongated, and some even have a satellite


## Comet
A comet also orbits the Sun, but unlike an [[#Asteroid]], it's composed of ice and dust. So, when a comet gets close to the Sun, its ice and dust content start to vaporize. So, when seen in a telescope, a comet appears fuzzy and/or has a tail.


## Meteor
A meteoroid is a small piece of [[#Asteroid]] or a [[#Comet]], typically pebble-sized, but could be a little smaller or a little larger, and often created from a collision. When a meteoroid gets close to the Earth and enters the Earth's atmosphere, it's called a meteor. 

A meteor enters the Earth's atmosphere at a very high speed, so it burns up and produces a streak of light called a shooting star. So, if you have seen a shooting star, you likely saw a meteor. And if a meteor survives the burn and lands on the ground, it's called a meteorite.

**Difference between asteroids, comets, and meteors**: asteroids are rocky, comets are icy, and meteors are much smaller and are seen as shooting stars
