## The Sun
**Parameters**:
- $M_\odot \simeq 2\times 10^{30} \,\pu{kg}$
- $R_\odot \simeq 7\times 10^8 \,\pu{m}$
- $P_\odot$ ~ 1 month
- $L_\odot \simeq 3.8\times10^{26}\,\pu{W}$

The sun has a core, radiate and then covective zone. The region between the radiative and convective zones is called the tachocline and this is thought to be the origin of the magnetic field. As such, fully convective stars are not thought to have strong magnetic fields.

## Heliopause
The theoretical boundary where the Sun's solar wind is stopped by the [[ISM|ISM]]. Bounds the [[#Heliosphere]]. Location defined by pressure balance, at about $120\,\pu{AU}$ as measured by voyager.


## Heliosphere
The wake of the solar wind through the [[ISM|ISM]] formed by the movement of the Sun and solar wind. The "termination shock" within is the point where the solar winds slows to subsonic speed relative to the motion of the Sun
