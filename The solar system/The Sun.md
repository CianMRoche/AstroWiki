## The Sun
**Parameters**:
- $M_\odot \simeq 2\times 10^{30} \,\pu{kg}$
- $R_\odot \simeq 7\times 10^8 \,\pu{m}$
- $P_\odot$ ~ 1 month


## Heliopause
The theoretical boundary where the Sun's solar wind is stopped by the [[Interstellar medium|ISM]]. Bounds the [[#Heliosphere]]. Location defined by pressure balance, at about $120\,\pu{AU}$ as measured by voyager.


## Heliosphere
The wake of the solar wind through the [[Interstellar medium|ISM]] formed by the movement of the Sun and solar wind. The "termination shock" within is the point where the solar winds slows to subsonic speed relative to the motion of the Sun
