A gravitationally bound collection of <mark class="hltr-grey">50 or fewer</mark> galaxies, each at least as luminous as the Milky Way (~$10^{10}\, L_\odot$). Smaller than a [[#Galaxy cluster|galaxy cluster]] at about $10^{13}\, M_\odot$. The [[Milky Way#Milky way|Milky Way]] is part of a galaxy group called the [[#Local Group]].

The first discovered galaxy group was Stephan's quintet below

**Typical parameters**:
- $<50$ member galaxies
- Mass: ~$10^{13}$ $M_\odot$ 
- Diameter: 1-2 Mpc
