Smaller than a [[#Galaxy cluster|galaxy cluster]] at about $10^{13}\, M_\odot$. The [[Objects#Milky way|Milky Way]] is part of a galaxy group called the [[Objects#Local group|local group]].

The first discovered galaxy group was [[Objects#Stephan's quintet|Stephan's quintet]]

**Typical parameters**:
- $<50$ member galaxies
- Mass: ~$10^{13}$ $M_\odot$ 
- Diameter: 1-2 Mpc
