## Galaxy group
A gravitationally bound collection of <mark class="hltr-grey">50 or fewer</mark> galaxies, each at least as luminous as the Milky Way (~$10^{10}\, L_\odot$). Smaller than a [[#Galaxy cluster|galaxy cluster]] at about $10^{13}\, M_\odot$. The [[Milky Way#Milky way|Milky Way]] is part of a galaxy group called the [[#Local Group]].

**Typical parameters**:
- $<50$ member galaxies
- Mass: ~$10^{13}$ $M_\odot$ 
- Diameter: 1-2 Mpc

The first discovered galaxy group was Stephan's quintet:

## Local Group
A [[Galaxy groups#Galaxy group|galaxy group]] which hosts the [[Milky Way#Milky Way|Milky Way]] (that is, we live in it). About 100 galaxies. The maor components are, in order of mass

**Components**
1. [[Galaxy examples#M31|Andromeda (M31)]] (merger with Milky Way coming in about $4\,\pu{Gyr}$)
2. The [[Milky Way#Milky Way|Milky Way]]
3. Triangulum (M33)
4. The [[Galaxy examples#Large Magellanic Cloud|LMC]] and SMC
5. Many dwarf galaxies
