## Galaxy cluster
A gravitationally bound collection of <mark class="hltr-grey">hundreds to thousands</mark> of galaxies. 2nd largest gravitationally-bound structure in the universe after cosmic filaments. Bigger than a [[Galaxy groups#Galaxy group|galaxy group]].

**Composition**: (percentages of mass)
- Galaxies 1%
- [[Cluster media#Intracluster medium|ICM]] 9%
- Dark matter 90%

**Typical parameters**:
- $10^2$ to $10^3$ member galaxies
- Mass: $10^{14}-10^{15}$ $M_\odot$ 
- Diameter: 1-5 Mpc

**Examples**:
- Virgo cluster
- Noma cluster
- Pheonix cluster
- Bullet cluster
- [[Galaxy cluster examples#Perseus cluster|Perseus cluster]]


## Brightest cluster galaxy
Largest/brightest galaxy in a [[#Galaxy cluster]]
Large amount of X-ray emission

**Observation strategies**:
- Can observe molecular gas emission, but need ~$10^8\,M_\odot$ of stellar mass to observe this confidently (can do with [[Observatories#ALMA|ALMA]])
- Molecular absorption of AGN backlight in radio to probe mass scales of ~10s to 100s of $M_\odot$ since very strong absorption lines from CO, HCO$^+$, HNC, H$_2$CO and SiO. Width of absorption feature increases with velocity dispersion -> proximity to [[#AGN]]'s supermassive black hole. Does require presence and alignment of BCG disk with AGN
