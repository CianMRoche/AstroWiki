"Tidal disruption event". When a star is tidally disrupted by a [[Black holes#Black hole|BH]] in the center of a galaxy (an [[AGN]] perhaps), and is shredded into strands and a cloud of stellar debris.

From talk by Jean Somalwar - Caltech:

Allows one to 
- probe [[Accretion]] physics by studying the formation of an eccretion disk (or contribution to it) in "real-time"
- Identify [[Black holes#Black hole|BHs]] in non-active, distant [[Galaxies]].
- "Suddenly" be able to see [[Dust]] etc surrounding

**Observational Signatures**
- Outflow can collide with circumnuclear medium and the shock can lead to [[Magnetobremsstrahlung#Synchrotron radiation|synchrotron]] peaking in the radio. 
- There is also optical emission (missed the origin)
- Typically see an anticorrelation in luminosity in each band (that is, if bright in X-ray it isnt in optical, etc). TDEs selected/found in different bands have different physics
- Some have jets, some have nonrelativistic wide-angle outflows 
- High variance amongst light curves
- Can be hard to distinguish from other weird [[AGN]] activity, so candidates are selected from galactic uclei that are otherwise quiet

Seen in [[Observatories#eRosita|eRosita]] and [[Observatories#ZTF|ZTF]]. [[Observatories#VLA|VLA]] does a radio survey ("VLASS") which we use to select those radio-bright ones. That survey is ~5 years timescale so can observe evolution of those systems over that timescale

Beaming unlikely to play a role, because the radio spectra (+over time) are consistent with nonrelativistic evolution.
