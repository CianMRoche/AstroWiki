## Galaxy
A gravitationally bound collection of $10^6-10^{13}\,M_\odot$ of stars. 3nd largest gravitationally-bound structure in the universe after cosmic filaments and [[Galaxy clusters#Galaxy cluster|galalxy clusters]]. Bigger than a [[Galaxy groups#Galaxy group|galaxy group]]. Contains many subclasses of galaxy over a wide range of masses, morphologies and chemical compositions. It is thought that all galaxies have a massive [[Black holes#Black hole|black hole]] at the center, but there are some examples where models with no black hole fit as well as those with black hoels (eg. NGC 1277). 

**Typical diameters**:
- Dwarf galaxies: $1-10\,\pu{kpc}$
- Spiral galaxies: $10-50\,\pu{kpc}$
- Elliptical galaxies: $10-200\,\pu{kpc}$
- Lenticular galaxies (large scale disk but no spiral arms): $5-50\,\pu{kpc}$

**Examples**:
- [[Milky Way]]
- [[Galaxy examples#M31|M31]]
- [[Galaxy examples#Large Magellanic Cloud|LMC]]

Here are examples of what the different types look like:

## Radio galaxy
A [[#Galaxy]] with giant regions of [[Spectra#The electromagnetic spectrum|radio]] emission extending well beyond its visible structure. Large radio lobes driven by [[AGN#AGN|AGN]] activity.

Often corresponds to [[AGN#Fanaroffâ€“Riley classification|type 2]] [[AGN]]

## Starburst galaxy
Starburst Galaxies are the galaxies where massive stars are forming at a very high rate (about $10^3$ times greater than in a normal galaxy like our [[Milky Way]]). 

- The optical and infrared [[Units#Luminosity|luminosities]] observed from these sources are dominated by radiation from these young massive stars, indicating that there is a high concentration of gas and radiation in localized regions. 
- These massive stars have relatively shorter lifetimes and at the end of their lifetime, they explode as [[Supernovae#Supernova|supernovae]]. Thus starburst regions are an ideal environment for the acceleration of [[Cosmic rays#Cosmic rays|cosmic rays]]. 
- These supernovae enrich the central star-forming regions with relativistic cosmic rays (protons, electrons and positrons). 
- Cosmic ray energy densities in SBGs are orders of magnitude higher compared to normal galaxies (see [[Emission & the ISM - Questions#82|Q82]]).


## Disk galaxy
The presence of a disk in a galaxy is determined more by its formation history and environment than by its age, but disk galaxies are less likely to be seen than ellipticals in [[Galaxy clusters#Galaxy cluster|galaxy clusters]] due to the following factors:

1.  Environmental effects: The hot, dense gas found in galaxy clusters can exert strong tidal forces and gravitational interactions on galaxies, stripping away their gas and dust and disrupting their orbits. This can disrupt the formation and maintenance of disk structures and lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies.
2.  Mergers and interactions: Galaxy clusters are very crowded environments, and the high relative speeds of galaxies can lead to frequent mergers and interactions. These violent interactions can disrupt disk structures and lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies. The more time spent in the cluster, the more potential mergers can occur.

**Thin versus thick disk**
The disk is actually comprised of a thick and thin component (in the [[Milky Way#Milky Way|Milky Way]] at least)
Here are some key differences between the thin disk and the thick disk:

1.  Structure: 
   - <mark class="hltr-cyan">Thin disk</mark> is $\sim 250\,\pu{pc}$ thick and contains a majority of the Milky Way's stars, gas, and dust. 
   - <mark class="hltr-red">Thick disk</mark> is $\sim 1\,\pu{kpc}$ thick and has a more spheroidal shape. Diameter is about half that of the thin disk.
2.  Age: 
   - <mark class="hltr-cyan">Thin disk</mark> stars typically younger (less than 10 billion years old) and more metal-rich.
   - <mark class="hltr-red">Thick disk</mark> stars typically older (more than 10 billion years old) and more metal-poor.
3.  Motion: 
   - <mark class="hltr-cyan">Thin disk</mark> more circular orbits that are mostly confined to the plane of the disk.
   - <mark class="hltr-red">Thick disk</mark> more eccentric and inclined orbits that are tilted with respect to the thin disk.  
4.  Origin: 
   - <mark class="hltr-cyan">Thin disk</mark> is believed to have formed from the collapse of a gas cloud that was enriched with heavy elements from previous generations of stars.
   - <mark class="hltr-red">Thick disk</mark> is thought to have formed from the heating and thickening of the thin disk due to interactions with other galaxies, mergers, or accretion events.


## Spiral arm clumpiness
The density profile along a spiral arm looks like this (from Choudhuri)
![[spiral_arm_clustering.png]]The reason for this is very cool, and related to magnetic buoyancy. The same feature will arise in any disky thing where magnetic field lines are [[Plasma and lensing - Questions#95|frozen in]]. Basically the following very coarse outline occurs
- An underdensity perturbation appears in the arm
- This underdense region in a denser region (like a bubble in water), the underdense region will be pushed out. 
- The path of least resistance is out of the disk or pushed out of the arms
- Since the magnetic field lines are frozen into the material, the field lines are bent. They then are kept from bending further due to magnetic tension, preventing material from going too far.
- Why dont we break freeze-in? No idea.
- The result is that the density profile looks very clumpy along the profile of a magnetically frozen-in region in the disk (like the spiral arm)
