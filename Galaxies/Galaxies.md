## Starburst galaxy
Starburst Galaxies are the galaxies where massive stars are forming at a very high rate (about 10^3 times greater than in a normal galaxy like our [[Milky Way]]). 

- The optical and infrared [[Units#Luminosity|luminosities]] observed from these sources are dominated by radiation from these young massive stars, indicating that there is a high concentration of gas and radiation in localized regions. 
- These massive stars have relatively shorter lifetimes and at the end of their lifetime, they explode as [[Supernovae#Supernova|supernovae]]. Thus starburst regions are an ideal environment for the acceleration of [[Cosmic rays#Cosmic rays|cosmic rays]]. 
- These supernovae enrich the central star-forming regions with relativistic cosmic rays (protons, electrons and positrons). 
- Cosmic ray energy densities in SBGs are orders of magnitude higher compared to normal galaxies (see [[Emission & the ISM - Questions#82|Q82]]).
