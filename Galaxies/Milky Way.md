## Milky Way
The Milky Way did have an "active" phase where there was greater feedback (maybe from [[AGN examples#Sagittarius A*|Sagittarius A*]], which is why we see large clouds of ionized gas around the Milky Way.

Not to be confused with the [[#Milksy Way]]


## Milksy Way
Does not exist[^1]. Potential misspelling of [[#Milky Way]]
