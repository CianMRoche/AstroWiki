## Sagittarius A
This actually is no longer classified as active, so shouldnt really be in this section. 

A complex [[Spectra#Radio source|radio source]] at the center of the [[Milky Way#Milky Way|Milky Way]]. It refers to compact region around the supermassive black hole, <mark class="hltr-pink">Sagittarius A*</mark>, as well as the black hole itself. It resides in the constellation Sagittarius, and is invisible in the optical due to [[Dust#Dust|dust]] along the sight line in the Milky Way Galactic disk.
