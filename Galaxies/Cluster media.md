(Media as in plural of medium)


## CGM
"Circumgalactic medium". 
**Observation strategies**:
1. Observing a [[#Quasar|quasar]] behind the CGM and analysing the CGM's impact on the spectrum of the quasar.
	**Advantages**: does not depend on host galaxy's luminosity or redshift
	**Disadvantages**: Must have quasar behind
  
2. "Down the barrel spectroscopy" Observing the host galaxy's spectrum through the CGM 
	**Advantages**: Probes innermost radii 
	**Disadvantages**: depends on galaxy's flux though, lose radial position information

3. Spectroscopic cube around the host galaxy 
	**Advantages**: great spatial info
	**Disadvantages**: highly eroded by redshift, and requires dense, hot gas


## ICM
"Intracluster medium"


## Cooling flow
The hot [[#ICM]] in the cores of [[Galaxy clusters#Galaxy cluster|galaxy clusters]] should be cooling at ~10s to 1000s of $M_\odot\,\pu{yr^{-1}}$ by emission of X-rays (and forming into stars) where
$$L \propto \rho^2 \,T^{-1/2}$$
since $L$ ~ $\int dV\,$(rate of interactions/volume) and rate/vol ~ $\rho^2 \sigma v$ (weird assumptions going into why the integral doesnt matter, maybe we're assuming V remains constant when increasing $\rho\,$?). And the scattering cross section for [[Bremsstrahlung#Bremsstrahlung|bremsstrahlung]] goes as $T^{-1/2}$

The cooling flow is the ICM flowing in to that cooled region
