## AGN
"Active galactic nucleus". A compact region in a galactic center with high luminosity not produced by stars. This luminosity is theorized to arise from accretion onto a supermassive [[#Black Hole|black hole]] at the center of the galaxy.

Cold [[#Molecular cloud|molecular gas]] falls onto the AGN (from [[#Brightest cluster galaxy|BCG]] usually) and fuels jets, lobes and feedback

**Feedback**: 
- Accretion onto BH -> Jets -> Bubbles -> ICM.
- Early stage is supersonic expansion until the movement of the bubble itself becomes faster than the expansion, then detachment of bubble. Enough energy in bubbles to balance radiative cooling


## Quasar
A highly luminous [[#AGN]]. AKA "QSO" (quasi-stellar object)

**Catalogs**: [[Catalogs#SDSS|SDSS]] and [[Catalogs#LAMOST|LAMOST]] 


## Blazar
A [[#Quasar|quasar]] with a relativistic jet pointing along out line of sight


## Collapsar
