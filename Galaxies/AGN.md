## AGN
"Active galactic nucleus". A compact region in a galactic center with high luminosity not produced by stars. This luminosity is theorized to arise from accretion onto a supermassive [[Black holes#Black hole|BHs]] at the center of the galaxy.

**Typical parameters**:
Size = 1 gravitational radius $R_g = GM/c^2$ (?) ~ $10^{-2}\,\pu{pc}$ 
Size of disk ~ $10^4\,R_g$ ~ $100\,\pu{pc}$ 

Cold [[#Molecular cloud|molecular gas]] falls onto the AGN (from [[#Brightest cluster galaxy|BCG]] usually) and fuels jets, lobes and feedback

**Feedback**: 
- Accretion onto BH -> Jets -> Bubbles -> ICM.
- Early stage is supersonic expansion until the movement of the bubble itself becomes faster than the expansion, then detachment of bubble. Enough energy in bubbles to balance radiative cooling

**Corona**:
The region at the base of a jet or roughly a spherical plasma region {contentious}. Know close to the SMBH due to [[Methods#Reverberation mapping|reverberation mapping]] signal of [[Spectra#Fe k-alpha line|Fe]]-K$\alpha$ line (6.4 keV) and its time delays.

Coronal X-rays are thermal (blackbody) photons the are Compton up-scattered to x-ray wavelengths by the corona.



## Quasar
A highly luminous [[#AGN]]. AKA "QSO" (quasi-stellar object). Outshines the rest of the galaxy
Galaxy mergers can trigger AGN and quasar activity.

**Catalogs**: [[Catalogs#SDSS|SDSS]] and [[Catalogs#LAMOST|LAMOST]] 

**Observation strategies**: To observe the environment of a quasar you can use objects in the background (eg galaxies) and examine their light as absorbed by the environment of the quasar (ref: Christina Eilers talk)


## Seyfert
A Seyfert galaxy is an [[#AGN]] like a [[#Quasar]] but the host [[Galaxies#Galaxy|galaxy]] can be easily seen.


## Blazar
AKA "Bl-lac object". A [[#Quasar|quasar]] with a relativistic jet pointing along out line of sight. Have spectra dominated by featureless non-thermal continuum, which we would expect for a relativistic jet along the line of sight.


## Collapsar


## Fanaroffâ€“Riley classification
Classification of radio galaxies with active nuclei based on their radio luminosity or brightness of their radio emissions in relation to their hosting environment 

- FR1 arms can look bent due to [[Definitions - The Solar System#Ram pressure|ram pressure]] as galaxy moves through [[Cluster media#ICM|ICM]] 
- FR2 often looks one-sided due to relativistic boosting

confirmation is expensive, but is the proposed number of quasar pairs ~10^3? cant we estimate a population of 
What specific models are we trying to understand by quasar pair formation statistics?
