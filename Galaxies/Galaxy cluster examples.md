A [[Object Types#Galaxy cluster|galaxy cluster]] in the Perseus constellation. Also known as [[Catalogs#Abell|Abell]] 246. Populated by ~thousands of galaxies. Brightest X-ray cluster.

Exhibits a "flattened" bubble resulting from a jet, flattening is evidence of efficient energy transfer via gravity waves (from MAT talk on cluster bubbles by)

**Parameters**:
- Recession speed: ~5000 $\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ 
- Size: $15'$ $\simeq$ $300$ kpc (relatively small? Mike: probably just the size of the core)
- Distance: 74 Mpc 
- Redshift: 0.018
