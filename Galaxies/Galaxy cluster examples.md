## Perseus cluster
A [[Object Types#Galaxy cluster|galaxy cluster]] in the Perseus constellation. Also known as [[Catalogs#Abell|Abell]] 246. Populated by ~thousands of galaxies. Brightest X-ray cluster.

Exhibits a "flattened" bubble resulting from a jet, flattening is evidence of efficient energy transfer via gravity waves (from MAT talk on cluster bubbles by ???)

**Parameters**:
- Recession speed: ~5000 $\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ 
- Size: $15'$ $\simeq$ $300$ kpc (relatively small? Mike: probably just the size of the core)
- Distance: 74 Mpc 
- Redshift: 0.018


## Virgo Cluster


## Bullet Cluster


## Coma cluster
One of the first places where observed gravitational anomalies were considered to be indicative of unobserved mass. In 1933 Fritz Zwicky showed that the galaxies of the Coma Cluster were moving too fast for the cluster to be bound together by the visible matter of its galaxies $\implies$ [[Dark matter]].
