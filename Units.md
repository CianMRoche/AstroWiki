## Degree
Unit of <mark class="hltr-pink">angle</mark>: $1/360$ of a full rotation
$6^\circ$ = 6 degrees


## Arcminute
Unit of <mark class="hltr-pink">angle</mark>: $1/60$ of a degree
$4'$ = 4 arcmin
1arcmin ~ 1 Mpc at z=0.7


## Arcsecond
Unit of <mark class="hltr-pink">angle</mark>: 1/60 of an arcminute, $1/3600$ of a degree
$12''$ = 12 arcsec
8kpc per arcsec at z=0.8

## Proper distance
<mark class="hltr-pink">Distance</mark> between objects including expansion of universe; changes in time, in contrast to [[#Comoving distance]].

**Examples**:
- pkpc = proper kiloparsec
- ply = proper light year

## Comoving distance
<mark class="hltr-pink">Distance</mark> between objects factoring out expansion of universe, such that two otherwise unmoving objects will have constant comoving distance over cosmological time. The comoving coordinate system evolves "with" the Hubble flow


## AU
Unit of <mark class="hltr-pink">distance</mark>. Distance from Earth to Sun
$1\,\pu{AU} \simeq 1.5\times 10^{11}\,\pu{m}$


## amu
Unit of <mark class="hltr-pink">mass</mark>. "atomic mass units". Defined as 1⁄12 of the mass of a free carbon-12 atom at rest in its ground state.

$1\,\pu{amu}\,\simeq\,1.66\times 10^{-27}\,\pu{kg}$  


## Luminosity
Units of power ($\pu{W}$). The energy per time leaving a (usually astrophysical) body. Intrinsic property of a source.


## Flux
Loosely used, generally refers to some power per area ($\pu{W\,m^{-2}}$). Not intrinsic property of source, depends on "observation"/"location" parameters such as distance from source.

*Specific* flux refers to the flux density in frequency space, such that $F_\nu(\nu)\,d\nu$ is the flux in the frequency band from $[\nu,\nu + d\nu]$ 


## Intensity
Refers to a flux per solid angle ($\pu{W\,m^{-2}}\,\rm{steradian}^{-1}$). Think "per unit area on my detector, what is the flux I get from a given solid angle on the sky". Since intensity is per unit area and solid angle, changing the size of your detector of viewing area (as long as the source is entirely within that area in each case) will not increase the intensity.![[intensity.png|450]]

*Specific* intensity refers to the intensity density in frequency space, such that $I_\nu(\nu)\,d\nu$ is the intensity in the frequency band from $[\nu,\nu + d\nu]$
