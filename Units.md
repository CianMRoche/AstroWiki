## Degree
Unit of <mark class="hltr-pink">angle</mark>: $1/360$ of a full rotation
$6^\circ$ = 6 degrees


## Arcminute
Unit of <mark class="hltr-pink">angle</mark>: $1/60$ of a degree
$4'$ = 4 arcmin
1arcmin ~ 1 Mpc at z=0.7


## Arcsecond
Unit of <mark class="hltr-pink">angle</mark>: 1/60 of an arcminute, $1/3600$ of a degree
$12''$ = 12 arcsec
8kpc per arcsec at z=0.8

## Proper distance
<mark class="hltr-pink">Distance</mark> between objects including expansion of universe; changes in time, in contrast to [[#Comoving distance]].

**Examples**:
- pkpc = proper kiloparsec
- ply = proper light year

## Comoving distance
<mark class="hltr-pink">Distance</mark> between objects factoring out expansion of universe, such that two otherwise unmoving objects will have constant comoving distance over cosmological time. The comoving coordinate system evolves "with" the Hubble flow
