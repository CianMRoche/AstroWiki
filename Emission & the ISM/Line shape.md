Lines are Voigt profiles intrinsically
- Gaussian from Maxwell-Boltzmann dist
- Lorentzian from quantum physics (energy uncertainty)

when you measure it becomes convolved with your PSF

Broadening can occur due to
1. Doppler / thermal broadening 
   (i think the Gaussian above)
   
2. Pressure broadening
   A combination of several effects (Van der Waals, Stark effect, collisional broadening), leading to broadening of lines in hot, dense environments.

- Giant star $\implies$ narrow lines
- Dwarf star $\implies$ broad lines (higher surface temperature for example)
