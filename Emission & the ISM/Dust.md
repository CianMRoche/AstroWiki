## Dust
Composition depends strongly on environment; micron-scale grains of silicates, hydrocarbons, ice and/or other molecules like $\ce{CO}$. Absorbs in [[Spectra#The electromagnetic spectrum|UV]] and emits [[Blackbody radiation#Blackbody radiation|thermally]] in far-IR (near IR remains fairly unaffected).

Typically produced by fairly evolved stars shedding their outer layers.

However: We've seen very high redshift objects obscured by dust, suggesting another mechanism (maybe SNe?) can produce dust at earlier times.
