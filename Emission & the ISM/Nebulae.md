## Nebula
A luminescent, diffuse part of the [[ISM|interstellar medium]], often star-forming regions. 

**Consist of**: 
- ionized, neutral or [[Spectra#Molecular hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]] 
- cosmic [[#Dust|dust]]
- Particle density ~$10^{4}\,\pu{cm^{-3}}$ ([[Objects#Earth|Earth]] at sea level has ~$10^{19}\,\pu{cm^{-3}}$)

**Examples**:
- Eagle nebula (star-forming Pillars of Creation within)
- Crab nebula
- Orion nebula (brightest nebula)
- Carina nebula


## Emission nebula
Circumstellar junk. A [[#Nebula|nebula]] formed of ionized gas emitting in various wavelengths. The most common source of ionization is high-energy ultraviolet photons emitted from a nearby hot star. 

**Types**:
- H II regions, in which star formation is taking place and young, massive stars are the source of the ionizing photons
- [[#Planetary nebula|Planetary nebulae]]


## Planetary nebula
An [[#Emission nebula]] from the outer layers of a dying intermediate mass ($0.8 M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 8 M_\odot$) star as the outer envelope expands away after the [[HR-diagram#AGB|AGB]] phase
- Envelope lost from strong stellar winds in AGB phase
- The hot [[Stellar classes#White dwarf|WD]] core irradiates the ejected stellar envelope with strong [[Spectra#The electromagnetic spectrum|UV]] radiation, ionizing the gas.
- Name comes from the fact that theyre round-ish and telescopes used to be bad

## Reflection nebula
Clouds of interstellar [[Dust#Dust|dust]] which reflect the light of a nearby star, in which the energy of the light is insufficient to ionize the material and create an [[#Emission nebula|emission nebula]], so the light is instead scattered by the dust, making it visible. Shown is [[Catalogs#IC|IC]] 2631

## Dark nebula
A [[Star formation#Molecular cloud|molecular cloud]] for which enough [[Dust]] is present and the medium is dense enough to block visible light from background sources like stars, [[Nebulae#Emission nebula|emission nebulae]] or [[Nebulae#Reflection nebula|reflection nebulae]].
