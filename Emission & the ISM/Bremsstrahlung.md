A highly detailed overview of all this in [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.5949.pdf) (radiative processes in high energy astrophysics by Ghisellini)

## Bremsstrahlung
AKA "Braking radiation". Electromagnetic radiation produced by the deceleration of a charged particle when deflected by another charged particle, typically an electron by an atomic nucleus. Same thing as [[Scattering#Free-free emission|free-free emission]], since both particles are unbound both before and after collision. More prominent from electrons than other species since the power scales inversely with mass.

Thermal bremsstrahlung is the bremsstrahlung emission form a distribution of electrons following the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (ie thermalized). I guess power emitted proportional to $\sqrt{T}$ but i dont have a good explanation. Emits a continuous spectrum with the following features:

Why?
- On low end, if we have an optically thick medium then radiated photons will be quickly re-absorbed, and we will get a [[Blackbody radiation#Blackbody radiation|blackbody]] in the low-frequency limit (ie the Rayleigh-Jeans limit). Taylor expand the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution to get $$B_\nu \propto \frac{\nu^3}{e^{\frac{h\nu}{kT}} - 1}\simeq \nu^3 \frac{kT}{h\nu} \propto \nu^2$$
- Cant emit photon with much higher energy than $\sim kT$ so cutoff on high end
- Why flat between? Not sure.
