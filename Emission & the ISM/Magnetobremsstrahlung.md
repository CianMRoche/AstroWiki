The magnetic counterpart to [[Bremsstrahlung#Bremsstrahlung|bremsstrahlung]]. 

Great summary and explanation [here](https://jila.colorado.edu/~pja/astr3730/lecture10.pdf)

## Synchrotron radiation
Electromagnetic radiation emitted by relativistic accelerating charged particles deflected by a magnetic field. The relativistic counterpart to [[#Cyclotron radiation]].

Relativistic effects are beaming and pulses are effectively shortened. Net effect is that the cyclotron spectrum for a single particle becomes (y axis is [[Units#Flux|specific flux]])

## Cyclotron radiation
Electromagnetic radiation emitted by non-relativistic accelerating charged particles deflected by a magnetic field. The non-relativistic counterpart to [[#Synchrotron radiation]].

Much stronger emission from electrons than for heavier particles since power emitted $\propto 1/m^2$ (which is why highest energy particle accelerators are using protons and not electrons).

The name contains "cycle" because it is derived by considering a charged particle in circular motion with a certain frequency due to a uniform magnetic field. The spectrum then looks like a delta function at $\nu = qB/2\pi m c$ (might be in CGS units?) but in reality we also see weak harmonics at integer multiples of this frequency. As a result, can be a great way to measure magnetic fields.
