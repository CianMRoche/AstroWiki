## ISM
"Interstellar medium"

The components are organized in space (very) roughly as follows, basically goes dense + cold to diffuse and hot

A very useful way to think about these phases is as clouds on a temperature-density plot. Here's a really bad version of that, please make a better one for yourself. The blue is most prominent line.

The fact they lie along a straight line on a log-log plot with slope approximately equal to -1 means they are in pressure equilibrium, since $T\propto n^{-1} \implies P\propto nT \propto \text{const}$
