## The electromagnetic spectrum
- Quick conversion: $hc = 1240\,eV\,nm$ so roughly 1keV ~ 1nm since $E=hc/\lambda$
- Could also think of it as $hc \simeq 10^{-6}\,eV\,m$
 ![[EMSpectrum.png]]
 - Visible light [380,750] nm. 
 - ROY G. BIV to remember in order of increasing energy

## Redshift
$$1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{obs}}{\lambda_{emit}} = \frac{\nu_{emit}}{\nu_{obs}}$$

## Hertzsprung-Russel diagram
This diagram demonstrates the clustering between the [[HarvardSpectralClassification.png|color]] (temperature) of stars to their intrinsic luminosity ([[Magnitudes#Absolute magnitude|absolute magnitude]])

## Main sequence
A line (and thus, evolutionary track) that can be identified on the [[#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram]] which comprises ~90% of known stars, including the [[Objects#The Sun|Sun]]. 


## OII doublet
Traces cool, ionized gas. Has been used to trace [[Object Types#CGM|CGM]]. Ratio of two lines depends on the temperature


## H$\alpha$
Atomic hydrogen Balmer line, _n_ = 3 to _n_ = 2 transition. Wavelength 650 nm ~ 2eV

Emitted by many [[Object Types#Emission Nebula|emission nebulae]] and can be used to observe features in the [[Objects#The Sun|Sun]]'s atmosphere, including solar prominences and the chromosphere


## Molecular hydrogen
H doesnt have a rotational dipole, only a vibrational. Finding H2 was usually done by measuring CO with millimeter telescopes and then constraining the CO H2 correllation. Now with JWST this can be done better, since we have a mid IR IFU in space.

Doesnt have a Balmer series equivalent because the binding energy of molecular hydrogen is about 4eV, so those energies would just unbind the molecule.


## P Cygni Line Profile
Spectroscopic feature with both a blueshifted absorption line and a broadened rest wavelength emission line arising from an expanding envelope around an ionized source

## Harvard Spectral Classification
- Classifies stars into spectral type based on temperature 
- Originally classes A-Q based on strength of hydrogen lines in spectra, but found that there was lots of overlap amongst categories (and also they were in the wrong order for other properties)
- Cannot distinguish between same color, same apparent magnitude, but different luminosity stars (need [[Spectra#Morgan-Keenan (MK or MKK) Luminosity Class|MK Luminosity Classification]])
![[HarvardSpectralClassification.png]]
- Oh Be A Fine Goat Kick Me (OBAFGKM). Note the hydrogen line strength is a gaussian at "A", mass, radius and lunimosity all decrease, and fraction of [[#Main sequence]] stars increases.

## Morgan-Keenan (MK or MKK) Luminosity Class
Stellar classification based on spectral line widths to distinguish between stars with the same color/temperature and apparent magnitude, but different luminosities/distances
- denser objects have broader spectral lines due to increased pressure/collisional broadening and higher surface gravity
- complementary to [[Spectra#Harvard Spectral Classification|Harvard Spectral Classification]]

## Radio source
Atmosphere not too problematic, can perform radio observations even on cloudy days

**Solar system**:
- The [[Objects#The Sun|Sun]] 
- Jupiter 

**Galactic**:
- Galactic center


## X-ray background
**Sources**:
- Focused onto detector - Diffuse hot gas from Milky Way + unresolved point sources. Below 1-2keV, XRB dominates signal
- Particle BG - cosmic rays
- Unfocused cosmic hard X-ray background, constant in time

Eric Miller(?MIT?) - Model your Xray BG, dont subtract it.
