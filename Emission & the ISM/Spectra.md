## The electromagnetic spectrum
- Quick conversion: $hc = 1240\,eV\,nm$ so roughly 1keV ~ 1nm since $E=hc/\lambda$
- Could also think of it as $hc \simeq 10^{-6}\,eV\,m$
 ![[EMSpectrum.png]]
 - Visible light [380,750] nm. 
 - ROY G. BIV to remember in order of increasing energy

## Redshift
$$1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{obs}}{\lambda_{emit}} = \frac{\nu_{emit}}{\nu_{obs}}$$

## Hertzsprung-Russel diagram
This diagram demonstrates the clustering between the [[HarvardSpectralClassification.png|color]] (temperature) of stars to their intrinsic luminosity ([[Magnitudes#Absolute magnitude|absolute magnitude]])
![[HRDiagram.png|]]


## Main sequence
A line (and thus, evolutionary track) that can be identified on the [[#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram]] which comprises ~90% of known stars, including the Sun. 


## OII doublet
Traces cool, ionized gas. Has been used to trace [[Object Types#CGM|CGM]]. Ratio of two lines depends on the temperature


## H$\alpha$
Atomic hydrogen Balmer line, _n_ = 3 to _n_ = 2 transition. Wavelength 650 nm ~ 2eV

Emitted by many [[Object Types#Emission Nebula|emission nebulae]] and can be used to observe features in the [[Objects#The Sun|Sun]]'s atmosphere, including solar prominences and the chromosphere


## 21cm line
Sping flip of neutral hydrogen. Corresponding energy $\sim 6\, \mu \pu{eV}$ or about $1.4\,\pu{GHz}$

Maps neutral hydrogen in radio wavelengths, [[Observatories#CHIME|CHIME]] can observe it. [[Observatories#MEERKAT|MEERKAT]] also did this recently.

**Halo model of H1 power spectrum**
A model for the H1 power spectrum with 2halo, 1halo and shot noise terms, dpeending also on some temperature? Need to look into.


## Lyman-$\alpha$ forest
- Lyman series is transitions of atomic hydrogen to $n=1$ 
- Lyman-$\alpha$ is the first one ($n=2$ to $n=1$) and is $120\,\pu{nm}$
- Strong absorbtion in air, so usually done in space. Highly-redshifted sources can penetrate though

The **Lyman-$\mathbf{\alpha}$ forest** is a series of absorbtion lines corresponding to the absorbtion of distant background light by gas clouds at different redshifts, each absorbing at the Lyman-$\alpha$ transition. In principle, the absorbtion spectrum in this case is a map of the gas between the observer and the source, including redshift information.


## Molecular hydrogen
H doesnt have a rotational dipole, only a vibrational. Finding H2 was usually done by measuring CO with millimeter telescopes and then constraining the CO H2 correllation. Now with JWST this can be done better, since we have a mid IR IFU in space.

Doesnt have a Balmer series equivalent because the binding energy of molecular hydrogen is about 4eV, so those energies would just unbind the molecule.


## Fe k-alpha line
Fe-K$\alpha$ line (6.4 keV) AGN shows up in x-ray spectrum


## P Cygni Line Profile
Spectroscopic feature with both a blueshifted absorption line and a broadened rest wavelength emission line arising from an expanding envelope around an ionized source

## Harvard Spectral Classification
- Classifies stars into spectral type based on temperature 
- Originally classes A-Q based on strength of hydrogen lines in spectra, but found that there was lots of overlap amongst categories (and also they were in the wrong order for other properties)
- Cannot distinguish between same color, same apparent magnitude, but different luminosity stars (need [[Spectra#Morgan-Keenan (MK or MKK) Luminosity Class|MK Luminosity Classification]])
![[HarvardSpectralClassification.png]]
- Oh Be A Fine Goat Kick Me (OBAFGKM). Note the hydrogen line strength is a gaussian at "A", mass, radius and lunimosity all decrease, and fraction of [[#Main sequence]] stars increases. 
 ![[OBAFGKM.jpeg|250]]
 - Each spectral type which is further divided into 10 sub-classes depending on the absorption features present in the spectrum. For example, the Sun has a temperature of about 5,700 Kelvin and is classified as a G2 star.


## Morgan-Keenan (MK or MKK) Luminosity Class
Stellar classification based on spectral line widths to distinguish between stars with the same color/temperature and apparent magnitude, but different luminosities/distances
- denser objects have broader spectral lines due to increased pressure/collisional broadening and higher surface gravity
- complementary to [[Spectra#Harvard Spectral Classification|Harvard Spectral Classification]]
![[MK.png]]
So the Sun is a **G2V** star


## Radio source
Atmosphere not too problematic, can perform radio observations even on cloudy days

**Solar system**:
- The Sun
- Jupiter 

**Galactic**:
- Galactic center


## X-ray background
**Sources**:
- Focused onto detector - Diffuse hot gas from Milky Way + unresolved point sources. Below 1-2keV, XRB dominates signal
- Particle BG - cosmic rays
- Unfocused cosmic hard X-ray background, constant in time

Eric Miller(?MIT?) - Model your Xray BG, dont subtract it.
