## Cosmic rays
Cosmic rays are high energy protons + atomic nuclei moving close to the speed of light.

**Sources**:
- [[The Sun]] for which they are often called "Solar energetic particles" or "SEPs".
- Galactic sources like [[Supernovae#Supernova|supernovae]] and their remnants (though they occur on a timescale of 1 every 50 years) 
- Extragalactic sources like [[AGN#AGN|AGN]], [[AGN#Quasar|quasars]] and [[GRBs#GRB|GRBs]].

Heres a summary of (something like the [[Units#Intensity|specific intensity]] ?) observed in cosmic rays in the upper Earth atmosphere. Takeaway is just the three horizontal lines describing rough rates at different energies.
