## Hydrostatic equilibrium
Where $M_r$ is mass enclosed within a spherical shell of radius $r$ $$\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{GM_r\rho}{r^2}$$

## Mass continuity
Where $M_r$ is mass enclosed within a spherical shell of radius $r$ $$\frac{dM_r}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho$$

## Temperature one


## Luminosity one
