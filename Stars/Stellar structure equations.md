## Hydrostatic equilibrium
Where $M_r$ is mass enclosed within a spherical shell of radius $r$ $$\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{GM_{<r}\rho}{r^2}$$**Derivation**:
Consider the following shell of mass, where in calculations we relabel $m(r)$ to $M_{<r}$
![[hydrostatic_equilibrium.png|300]]
The gravitational force on this mass shell is $$\mathrm{d} F_g=-\frac{G[\rho(r) \mathrm{d} r \mathrm{~d} A] M_{<r}}{r^2}$$In equilibrium, this gravitational force will be balanced by a pressure, the force of which is given by the difference in pressure pushing "down" from the outside and "out" from the inside, and we define the minus signs so $\mathrm{d} F_P$ points inward  $$\mathrm{d} F_P=[P(r)-P(r+\mathrm{d} r)] \mathrm{d} A=-\frac{\mathrm{d} P}{\mathrm{~d} r} \mathrm{~d} r \mathrm{~d} A$$Balancing the forces as $\mathrm{d} F_g+\mathrm{d} F_P = 0$ one finds $$\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{GM_{<r}\rho}{r^2}$$

## Mass continuity
Where $M_r$ is mass enclosed within a spherical shell of radius $r$ $$\frac{dM_{<r}}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho$$**Derivation**:
Fairly straight forward, $\frac{dM_{<r}}{dr}$ is the increase in mass by increasing $r$ by $dr$. Since $dM_{<r}$ is the same as the mass of a shall of radius $r$ and thickness $dr$ which is simply $dM_{<r} = V_{shell}\rho = 4\pi r^2 dr \rho$ we recover the above.
