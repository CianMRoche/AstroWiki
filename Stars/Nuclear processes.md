## r-process
AKA rapid neutron capture. "Arr process" like a pirate, because it makes gold (thanks Kaley). Can happen in a [[Binaries|binary]] [[Neutron stars#Neutron stars|NS]] merger. (Maybe also in collapsars, when a massive star collapses).

Bombard nucleus with neutrons, get unstable and heavy nucleus, then some of neutrons beta decay into protons and electrons (toward the valley of stability on the nuclides chart) and we get a new element.
