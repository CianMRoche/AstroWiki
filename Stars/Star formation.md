## Molecular cloud
AKA "stellar nursery" if stars are forming. A cloud of mostly [[Spectra#Molecular hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]] (since hot gas cools to molecular gas, can then form stars) and [[Dust#Dust|dust]], called a "[[Nebulae#Dark nebula|dark nebula]]" if enough dust is present and medium is dense enough to block visible light from background sources like stars, [[Nebulae#Emission nebula|emission nebulae]] or [[Nebulae#Reflection nebula|reflection nebulae]]. 

Very filamentary and chaotic-looking structure, which arises from a combination of gravitational collapse and turbulence (large scale).

These comprise less than 1% of the [[ISM#ISM|ISM]]. 


## Gravitational binding energy
The gravitational binding energy of a spherical mass distribution with constant density $\rho$ is $$U  -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$$**Derivation**:
Consider concentric shells of volume $dV = 4\pi r^3 dr$ and thus mass $dm = 4\pi r^2 \rho\, dr$. 

Each shell has gravitational potential energy $$dU = -G\frac{dm\,M_{<r}}{r} = -4\pi G r \rho M_{<r} dr$$where $M_{<r} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rho$ is the mass contained within the radius $r$. Then the total potential energy of the body is given by $$U = \int dU = \int_0^R dr (-4\pi G r \rho)\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rho\right) = \dots = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$$
