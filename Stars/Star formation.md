## Molecular cloud
AKA "stellar nursery" if stars are forming. A cloud of mostly [[Spectra#Molecular hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]] (since hot gas cools to molecular gas, can then form stars) and [[Dust#Dust|dust]], called a "[[Nebulae#Dark nebula|dark nebula]]" if enough dust is present and medium is dense enough to block visible light from background sources like stars, [[Nebulae#Emission nebula|emission nebulae]] or [[Nebulae#Reflection nebula|reflection nebulae]]. 

Very filamentary and chaotic-looking structure, which arises from a combination of gravitational collapse and [[Processes#Turbulence|turbulence]] (large scale).

These comprise less than 1% of the [[#Interstellar medium]]
