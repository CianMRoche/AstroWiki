## Molecular cloud
AKA "stellar nursery" if stars are forming. A cloud of mostly [[Spectra#Molecular hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]] (since hot gas cools to molecular gas, can then form stars) and dust, called a "dark nebula" if enough dust and dense enough to block visible light from background sources like stars, emission nebulae or reflection nebulae. Very filamentary and chaotic-looking structure, which arises from a combination of gravitational collapse and [[Processes#Turbulence|turbulence]] (large scale).

These comprise less than 1% of the [[#Interstellar medium]]
