## Hertzsprung-Russel diagram
This diagram demonstrates the clustering between the [[HarvardSpectralClassification.png|color]] (temperature) of stars to their intrinsic luminosity ([[Magnitudes#Absolute magnitude|absolute magnitude]]), and represents the evolution of stars along tracks in the diagram

## Main sequence
A line (and thus, evolutionary track) that can be identified on the [[#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram]] which comprises ~90% of known stars, including [[The Sun]].

A star is on the main sequence while it is burning Hydrogen to fuse Helium.


## Pre-main sequence
When the protostar becomes optically thick and approaches [[#Main sequence]] evolution, happens at
- $R\sim 100 R_\odot$ 
- $T\sim 10^{3.5}\,\pu{K}$

Grav contraction + heating occurs on [[Timescales#Kelvin-Helmholtz Timescale|Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale]] once in this phase, and since $\tau_{KH} \gg \tau_{ff}$ protostellar evolution is slow

Two phases: 
1. The [[#Hayashi track]], where the star isothermally contracts (~vertical line on [[HR-diagram#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram|HR diagram]])
2. The [[#Henyey track]], where the star increases its temperature (~horizontal line on [[HR-diagram#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram|HR diagram]])

In Phase 1 the protostar is convective and transitions to Phase 2 as the gas is heated + ionized by grav contraction leading to decreased opacity (wouldnt it be the opposite?) + increased radiative transport in the protostellar envelope
