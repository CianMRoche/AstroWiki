## Hertzsprung-Russel diagram
This diagram demonstrates the clustering between the [[HarvardSpectralClassification.png|color]] (temperature) of stars to their intrinsic luminosity ([[Magnitudes#Absolute magnitude|absolute magnitude]]), and represents the evolution of stars along tracks in the diagram

## Pre-main sequence
When the optically thick protostar approaches [[#Main sequence]] evolution, happens at
- $R\sim 100 R_\odot$ 
- $T\sim 10^{3.5}\,\pu{K}$

Grav contraction + heating occurs on [[Timescales#Kelvin-Helmholtz Timescale|Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale]] once in this phase, and since $\tau_{KH} \gg \tau_{ff}$ protostellar evolution is slow

Two phases: 
1. The [[#Hayashi track]], where the star isothermally contracts (~vertical line on [[HR-diagram#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram|HR diagram]])
2. The [[#Henyey track]], where the star increases its temperature (~horizontal line on [[HR-diagram#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram|HR diagram]])

In Phase 1 the protostar is convective and transitions to Phase 2 as the gas is heated + ionized by grav contraction leading to decreased opacity (wouldnt it be the opposite?) + increased radiative transport in the protostellar envelope.


## Hayashi track
Hayashi limit (on which this track lies) is boundary between allowed and forbidden regions of [[HR-diagram#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram|HR diagram]] for stars in [[Stellar structure equations#Hydrostatic equilibrium|hydrostatic equilibrium]]. Look at the limiting case of a fully convective star, and a [[Polytropes#Polytrope|polytropic]] equation of state (so $\gamma=1+2/3=5/3$).

The $T$ here is the effective blackbody temperature we would see. The core has ionized hydrogen but the envelope doesnt, so the ions go out and make $\ce{H^-}$ in the envelope which causes an increase in opacity. Even though the luminosity increases, the effective temperature remains low until the star gets hot enough to also ionize that $\ce{H^-}$ at which point the temperature rises quickly (the [[#Henyey track]]).

Star leaves Hayashi track after it contracts on [[Timescales#Kelvin-Helmholtz Timescale|thermal timescale]], central density increases, ionization increases and [[Optical depth#Opacity|opacity]] decreases (because neutral hydrogen does a lot of absorbing and ionized hydrogen just does a lot of scattering? see [[Scattering]]). At this point we move off the Hayashi track.


## Henyey track
Radiative energy transport, thermal radiation escapes as $\sim$ [[Blackbody radiation#Blackbody radiation|blackbody]] and $L$ remains roughly constant while $R$ decreases $\implies T \propto (L/R^2)^{1/4}$ and protostar moves left on diagram. 

![[Henyey.png|250]]
Stage ends when central temp becomes hot enough to fuse Hydrogen, at which point we move onto the [[#ZAMS]] (unless it doesnt have enough mass, in which case it becomes a [[Stellar classes#Brown dwarf|brown dwarf]]).


## ZAMS
"Zero-age [[#Main sequence]]". The theoretical locus of points in the [[#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram|HR-diagram]] where the luminosities of young stars (at a range of masses) are mostly supplied by the nuclear reactions that have begun in their cores. Basically its the set of points where stars can show up on the main sequence, sit there 

We often refer to the time since ZAMS as the age of the star, although prior to ZAMS the star is referred to as a protostar and the time for the collapse can be very significant. Furthermore, we often use the mass at ZAMS when talking about the mass of a star, ie "its mass when it entered the main sequence".


## Main sequence
A region that can be identified on the [[#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram]] which comprises ~90% of known stars, including [[The Sun]], containing stars which are burning Hydrogen to fuse Helium. This helium builds up in the core but is not fused into carbon yet, until core reaches $\sim 10^{8}\,\pu{K}$. 


## Subgiant branch
Star 


## RGB
"Red giant branch". Effectively the inverse evolution of the [[#Hayashi track]] whereby a star cant go to lower temperature and remain in [[Stellar structure equations#Hydrostatic equilibrium|HSE]] so its luminosity increases along a vertical line on [[#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram|HR-diagram]] after leaving the [[#Subgiant branch]] on the way to the [[#Helium flash]]. 


## Helium flash
The Helium flash is when: 
- core is degenerate, heats up until helium burning stars
- T increases a lot, which would usually increase $P$ but in degeneracy pressure dominated $P$ is indep of $T$, so no expand, $T$ rises in runaway manner and so does Helium burning. 
- This happens until $\sim 10^{11}\,L_\odot$ injected into the envelope in a few seconds, envelope lifts off a bit, allows core to expand and burning slows considerably to stable helium burning
- envelope contracts and enter [[#Horizontal branch]]. 


## Horizontal branch


## AGB
"Asymptotic giant branch". 


## Instability strip
A strip on the [[#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram|HR-diagram]] representing an instability of the radius and luminosity of stars to density and pressure fluctuations often via the [[Pulsating stars#Kappa-mechanism|Kappa mechanism]]. 

Why doesnt this occur across all the HR diagram?
- On the low $T$ end (red side), convection starts occurring in the envelope which increases mixing and prevents the development of the kappa mechanism
- On the high $T$ end (blue side), the He ionization zone is too far out in the stellar atmosphere to drive pulsations
