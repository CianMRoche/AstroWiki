## Dynamical timescale 
AKA "free-fall timescale". From dimensional analysis $$\tau_{dyn} = \left(\frac{R^3}{G M}\right)^{1/2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{G\rho}}$$


## Kelvin-Helmholtz Timescale
AKA "thermal timescale". Timescale with which star radiates away thermal energy$$\tau_{KH} = \frac{GM^2/R}{L}$$


## Main Sequence Timescale
AKA "nuclear timescale". Essentially a ratio of mass-energy to luminosity. How long a star will stay on the main sequence (ie how long would it take to burn all the mass if only hydrogen burning occurs) $$\tau_{MS} = \frac{f \eta X M_{\star} c^2}{L_{\star}}$$$f =$ fraction of H burned $\sim 0.1$ for radiative and $\sim 1$ for convective
$\eta = 0.007 =$ efficiency of nuclear burning
$X =$ mass fraction of H
$\tau_{MS,\odot} \sim 10 \,\pu{Gyr}$
