## Open cluster
A group of 10s to 1000s of stars formed from the same giant [[#Molecular cloud|cloud of molecular gas]] and thus have similar metallic properties, which is weakly gravitationally bound enough that they can be disrupted by close encounters with other clusters or clouds of gas. Less tightly bound than [[#Globular cluster|globular clusters]]. 


## Globular Cluster
- gravitationally bound spheroidal conglomeration of (10,000-few million) stars 
- higher concentration of stars toward center
- A dense environment in which dynamical interactions are more common, producing higher numbers of [[Binaries#X-ray binary|XRBs]] and [[Binaries#Cataclysmic variable|CVs]] per unit mass than in other clustered environments.

**Typical parameters**
- Mass: $\sim 10^4-10^6\,M_\odot$
