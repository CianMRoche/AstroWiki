## Cepheids


## RR-lyrae stars
Periodic variable stars, commonly found in [[Clustering#Globular Cluster|GCs]]. They are used as standard candles to measure (extra) galactic distances, assisting with the cosmic [[Hubble constant#Distance ladder|distance ladder]]. 

## Pulse sources
p modes have pressure restoring force
g has grav (deeper interior)
r has coriolis "inertial modes"

and each probes a different layer of the star. That said, there are mixed modes (eg. gravoinertial modes) that couple these effects.


## Pulsating binaries
One of them pulsating. Binaries can break some degeneracy in mode analysis mass from spectra tidal effects
