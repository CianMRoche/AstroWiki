## Cepheids


## RR-lyrae stars


## Pulse sources
p modes have pressure restoring force
g has grav (deeper interior)
r has coriolis "inertial modes"

and each probes a different layer of the star. That said, there are mixed modes (eg. gravoinertial modes) that couple these effects.


## Pulsating binaries
One of them pulsating. Binaries can break some degeneracy in mode analysis
mass from spectra
tidal effects
