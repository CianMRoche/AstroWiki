## Subdwarf O star
A <mark class="hltr-cyan">low mass, evolved star</mark>, hot enough to produce HeII lines

**Typical parameters**: 
- $T_{eff}$ = 37000 − 55000 K
- $\log g$ = 5.5 − 6
- $L$ = 20 − 100 $L_\odot$

**Examples**:
- [[Catalogs#Henry Draper|HD]] 128220


## Blue straggler
Michael told me to look this one up. Havent done that yet.


## Protostar
An early star which is not yet hot enough to start nuclear fusion, and is still gathering mass from parent [[Nebulae#Nebula|nebula]]. 
- Exists for ~ half a million years
- Temperature 2000-3000 K


## T-tauri star
Variable stars on [[HR-diagram#Hayashi track|Hayashi track]], variablility in [[Spectra#The electromagnetic spectrum|optical]] comes from obscuration by protoplanetary disk and winds, jets and starspots, also variable in X-ray and radio. Found in star-forming regions.

Central temperatures are too low for hydrogen fusion. Instead, they are powered by gravitational energy released as the stars contract, while moving towards the [[HR-diagram#Main sequence|main sequence]], which they reach after about 100 million years

**Typical parameters**:
Age $\lesssim10\,\pu{Gyr}$
Period $\sim 1-10\,\pu{days}$
Mass $<2\,M_\odot$


## M-dwarf
AKA "red dwarf" (with some caveats, see [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf)). M Dwarfs are low-mass and low-luminosity stars, and are the most common type of stars in the Milky Way. 

**Typical parameters**: 
- $T_{eff} \sim 2000-4000\,\pu{K}$ 
- $L \lesssim 0.08 L_\odot$
- $M \sim 0.08-0.45\,\pu{M_\odot}$

## White dwarf
AKA "degenerate dwarf". A stellar remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of all stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star, ie stars with $M\lesssim 8\,M_\odot$ who cant fuse carbons together and so cool down over time. It is effectively the exposed core of a star on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). Supported by electron degeneracy pressure (in contrast to the neutron degeneracy pressure of [[Neutron stars#Neutron stars|neutron stars]]). 

- See final states of stars of different masses in [[Compact objects - Questions#40|Q40]].
- In stars $\gtrsim 0.8\,M_\odot$, $\rm{He}$ fuses via the triple-$\alpha$ process into $\rm{C}$ and $\rm{O}$ and so WDs are thought to consist largely of carbon and oxygen.
- Can be modelled as different types of [[Polytropes#Polytrope|polytrope]] depending on mass
- Found on the high-T low-L part of the [[HR-diagram#Hertzsprung-Russel diagram|HR diagram]]

**Typical parameters**: 
- $R \sim 0.01-0.02\,R_\odot \sim R_\bigoplus$ 
- $\rho \sim 10^{4-7}\,\pu{g\,cm^{-3}} \ll \rho_{\text{neutron star}}$
- $M \sim 0.1-1.3\,\pu{M_\odot}$  
  
**More detailed description**
After the hydrogen-fusing lifetime of a [[Spectra#Main sequence|MS]] star of ~ low to medium mass ends, it will expand to a red giant which fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core by the triple-alpha process. If a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon, around 1 billion K, an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center. After shedding its outer layers to form a [[Nebulae#Planetary nebula|planetary nebula]], it will leave behind this core, which forms the remnant white dwarf. Usually, therefore, white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen. The material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions, so the star has no source of energy, nor is it supported by the heat generated by fusion against gravitational collapse. It is supported only by electron degeneracy pressure, causing it to be extremely dense. The physics of degeneracy yields a maximum mass for a non-rotating white dwarf, the Chandrasekhar limit, approximately 1.4 solar masses, beyond which it cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. A carbon-oxygen white dwarf that approaches this mass limit, either by accretion of mass from a companion star ("single-degenerate" progenitor) or via a WD-WD merger ("double-degenerate" progenitor), may explode as a Type Ia [[Supernovae#Supernova|supernova]].


## Pop N
From youngest to oldest:

**Pop 1**
- Metal-rich (ie young stars)
- Often found in spiral arms of a [[Galaxies#Galaxy|galaxy]] (since those are star-forming regions)
- elliptical orbits in the disk

**Pop 2**
- Metal-poor (ie old stars from an unenriched medium with few metals)
- Typically found in [[Clustering#Globular Cluster|GCs]] and the galactic bulge and halo
- More random orbits

**Pop 3**
- Theorized population of very first stars which formed when there were no metals at all ($z\simeq 20$)
- Not yet observed. Why?
	-  Too hard to image a star at such a high redshift (best change is lucky highly-magnified star via [[Lensing]])
	- Initial mass function for stars would have been high-mass skewed (why?) and thus most of these stars would have died by now.
	- Observable ones could also have been enriched by metals from their environment at this point.


## Brown dwarf
A "failed star" which did not have enough mass to start burning Hydrogen and fusing helium, bit it can fuse deuterium and a proton together to form Hydrogen 3 (distinguishing brown dwarfs from planets).
