## Pulsar timing
[[Observatories#NANOGrav|NANOGrav]] does it. Use [[Neutron stars#<mark class="hltr-orange">Pulsar</mark>|pulsars]] to construct a galactic-scale interferometer, with test masses bigger than the mass of the Sun. Use many millisecond pulsars to search for nHz GW signals (low freq because they're essentially a giant GW interferometer).

Millisecond pular: 
cycled to very short periods via accretion from a companion star.

Pulsar timing array: GWs produce correlated changes in pulse arrival times. Unlike LIGO need to account for gravitational wave perturbation both at the pulsar and the Earth. (?). Oh cuz We are not detecting with some detector like LIGO on Earth, we are deteching the GW strain on Earth itself, which changes the pulse arrival times at different telescopes. Maybe? Not sure.
