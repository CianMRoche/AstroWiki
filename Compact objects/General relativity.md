Here I'll just put some basic info, though note we are not currently required to know GR for the astro oral qual beyond basic knowledge of Schwarzschild and some things about [[Gravitational waves]].

## Schwarzschild
An exact (and vacuum-region) solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the gravitational field *outside* a spherical mass $M$, on the assumption that the electric charge of the mass, angular momentum of the mass, and universal cosmological constant are all zero. Omitting tensor notation entirely, the line element for proper time takes the form 
$$
- c^2 d\tau^2 = - \left( 1 - \frac{R_S}{r} \right) c^2 dt^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{R_S}{r} \right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 ( d\theta^2 + \sin^2{\theta} d\varphi^2)
$$
where $R_S = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$ is the **Schwarzschild radius** and we use the so-called "Schwarzschild coordinates"  
$$\begin{align}
t &\in (-\infty,\infty) \\
r &\in (0,\infty) \\
\theta &\in (0,\pi) \\
\varphi &\in (0,2\pi) \\
\end{align}$$


## Kerr



## Classical tests of GR
- Precession of perihelion of mercury
- Shapiro time delay
- Gravitational redshift
- Lensing (angle between real source and apparent source double what was predicted without GR)
- [[Gravitational waves]]
- Hulse-Taylor pulsar ([[Compact objects - Questions#56|Q56]])


## FLRW
Just linking to the [[FLRW]] metric and Friedmann equations.
