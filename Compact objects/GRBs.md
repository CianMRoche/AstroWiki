## GRB
"Gamma ray burst". 
- Jet-shaped bursts of high-energy gamma rays ($\gtrsim 100\,\pu{keV}$)
- Most energetic events since the big bang ($\sim 10^{47}\,\pu{J}$)
- Extragalactic, have never observed in the Milky Way. First detected by sattelites monitoring for forbidden nuclear testing. 
- Non-thermal and non-repeating, which separates them from soft gamma repeaters (which may just be [[Neutron stars#Magnetar|magnetars]]).

**Long GRBs**: Duration ~ seconds to minutes
Intense radiation thought to be released during a [[Supernovae#Supernova|supernova]] as a high-mass star implodes to form a [[Neutron stars#Neutron stars|neutron star]] or a [[Black holes#Black hole|black hole]]. Has been a recent observation of a 50s long GRB from a bniary compact object merger

**Short GRBs**: ~ millisconds to seconds
Appear to originate from the merger of binary [[Neutron stars#Neutron stars|neutron star]] systems during a [[Supernovae#Kilonova|kilonova]]. [[Observatories#LIGO|LIGO]] observed a NS-NS merger GW170817, 1.7 seconds after which a short GRB was detected by [[Observatories#Fermi|Fermi]]. Why after? The universe has no refractive index for gravitational waves(?).

After an initial flash of gamma rays, a longer-lived "afterglow" is usually emitted at longer wavelengths (see [[Compact objects - Questions#67|67]]).
