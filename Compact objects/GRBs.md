## GRB
"Gamma ray burst". Jet-shaped, most energetic events since the big bang. Extragalactic, have never observed in the Milky Way. 

**Long GRBs**: Duration ~ seconds to minutes
Intense radiation thought to be released during a [[Supernovae#Supernova|supernova]] as a high-mass star implodes to form a [[Neutron stars#Neutron stars|neutron star]] or a [[Black holes#Black hole|black hole]]. 

**Short GRBs**: ~ millisconds to seconds
Appear to originate from the merger of binary [[Neutron stars#Neutron stars|neutron star]] systems during a [[Supernovae#Kilonova|kilonova]].

After an initial flash of gamma rays, a longer-lived "afterglow" is usually emitted at longer wavelengths (see [[Compact objects - Questions#67|67]]).
