## Black hole
A region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon.

For the final state of stars of different masses, see [[Compact objects - Questions#40|Q40]].

**Intermediate mass**: 10s-100s of $M_\odot$
**Supermassive**: $>10^6\,M_\odot$ 


## ISCO
"Innermost stable circular orbit". Location depends on spin and mass. Can already see this feature in the effective keplerian potential as a function of angular momentum, then in GR we see a similar thing but the potential doesnt diverge toward zero.
