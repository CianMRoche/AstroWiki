## Black hole
A region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon.

For the final state of stars of different masses, see [[Compact objects - Questions#40|Q40]].

**Intermediate mass**: 10s-100s of $M_\odot$
**Supermassive**: $>10^6\,M_\odot$ 

To measure the mass of SMBH can look at time lags in the [[Spectra#Fe k-alpha line|FE k-alpha]] and $\rm{H}\beta$ lines. (Huh )


## ISCO
"Innermost stable circular orbit". Location depends on spin and mass. Can already see this feature in the effective keplerian potential as a function of angular momentum, then in GR we see a similar thing but the potential doesnt diverge toward zero.

## Pair instability gap
A mass range in which [[Black holes#Black hole|BHs]] are expected not to exist due to the destruction of their progenitors.

Expected that around $M_{BH} \sim 60-150\,M_\odot$ there should be pair production in the core of the progenitor star that reduces pressure that leads to partial collapse, followed by a thermonuclear explosion (aka [[Supernovae#Supernova|supernova]]) that destroys the star and leaves no remnant. [[Observatories#LIGO|LIGO]] result of GW190521 puts this into question. Like a type 1a but for really big stars, and after this mass limit they can probably collapse the material again to make a BH(?).
