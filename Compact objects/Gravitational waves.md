## Chirp mass
Chirp mass of a compact binary system determines the leading-order orbital evolution of the system as a result of energy loss from emitting gravitational waves. Because the gravitational wave frequency is determined by orbital frequency, the chirp mass also determines the frequency evolution of the gravitational wave signal emitted during a binary's inspiral phase.$$M_c = \frac{(M_1 M_2)^{3/5}}{  M^{1/5}}$$Note that the chirp mass experiences a degeneracy with [[Spectra#Redshift|redshift]]. What is actually derived from the observed gravitational waveform is the product $M_{c,\rm{eff}} = M_c(1+z)$ so in order to break this degeneracy one must also obtain the cosmological redshift (dominant to other sources of redshifting).


## Mass-weighted effective spin
Or "effective inspiral spin parameter". Qualifies the impact of the spins on the rate of inspiral, and where the binary plunges together to merge. It ranges from +1, meaning both black holes are spinning as fast as possible and rotate in the same direction as the orbital motion, to âˆ’1, both black holes spinning as fast as possible but in the opposite direction to the way that the binary is orbiting. A value of 0 for $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$ could mean that the black holes are not spinning, that their rotation axes are in the orbital plane (instead of aligned with the orbital angular momentum), or that one black hole is aligned with the orbital motion and the other is antialigned, so that their effects cancel out. See [source](https://cplberry.com/2017/06/01/gw170104/#GW170104-properties). It is defined by $$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}} = \frac{M_1 \vec{a}_1 + M_2 \vec{a}_2}{M_1 + M_2}\, \cdot \, \vec{L}$$where $\vec{L}$ is the orbital angular momentum of the binary


## Effective precession spin
Qualifies the amount of precession, the way that the orbital plane and black hole [spins wobble](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2vp7iVWrkE "YouTube: Simulation of GW170104") when they are not aligned. It is 0 for no precession, and 1 for maximal precession. Written $\chi_p$
