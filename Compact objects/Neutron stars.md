## Neutron stars

- Do we have a good idea for what the mass evolution looks like? Maybe no?
- We dont see lots of neutron star merger/collisions? Neutron stars dont have enough mass to dynamically "sink" to the center as black holes do. We expect BHs to merge in centers of galaxies but NSs to stay "out" and therefore have a lower chance of intercating
