## Neutron stars
- born in core-collapse supernovae
- Do we have a good idea for what the mass evolution looks like? Maybe no?
- We dont see lots of neutron star merger/collisions? Neutron stars dont have enough mass to dynamically "sink" to the center as black holes do. We expect BHs to merge in centers of galaxies but NSs to stay "out" and therefore have a lower chance of intercating

**Typical parameters**:
Mass: 1-2 $M_{\odot}$
Radius: ~10$\pu{km}$ (inner 9km behaves as one giant nucleus, since density ~ nucleus density)
Density: $10^{15} \pu{g cm^{-3}}$ (nuclear saturation density of an atom ~ $2\times 10^{14}\,\pu{g cm^{-3}}$)

- PULSAting Radio source
- highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits EM radiation out of its magnetic poles
- [[Spectra#RadioSource|Radio source]] (galactic and extragalactic)


## Neutron star equation of state
Want $P(\rho)$, but that assumes that the matter is at $T=0$ and at $\beta$-equilibrium (?). Apparently fine pre-binary merger, but not in the merging and post-merger phases. 

What global properties of a NS can constrain the microphysics of their dense-matter interactions?

Why is T reported in MeV? depend on # of d.o.f.?
