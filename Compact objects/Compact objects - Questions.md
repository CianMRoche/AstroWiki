**What do we know about the masses and spins of (i) stellar mass black holes and (ii) supermassive
black holes, and how do we know these things?**

1. **Stellar mass black holes**
   **Masses**:
   The masses as determined by [[Observatories#LIGO|LIGO]] and other GW observatories are summarized by the following, where EM typically refers to [[Binaries#X-ray binary|x-ray binary]] measurements. Note most BHs here are ~10s of stellar masses but we still consider them as "stellar mass black holes" here. Below, we discuss how these masses are obtained. One can see the proposed "lower" mass gap from 2-5 solar masses (based on the lack of observed candidates predicts the gap), and the "upper" mass gap from 50-150 (for which it is suggested gravitational collapse cannot directly produce a BH) appears to largely be the result of mergers. In both cases the objects detected in that range may be the result of mergers.![[BH_masses.jpg]]
   - For the EM observations, we determine the mass in the following way: Via the same derivation as the end of [[Exoplanets - Questions#8|8]] we have $$v_{1,r} = \left(\frac{2\pi G}{P}\right)^{1/3}\frac{M_2\sin(i)}{(M_1+M_2)^{2/3}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-e^2}}$$ and vice-versa for 2. Therefore we can constrain the total mass and therefore the mass of the compact object if we have radial velocity measurements.
   - The mass of a black hole has also been inferred by X-ray reverberation mapping, which uses the time lags between correlated X-ray signals to infer information about the environment very close to a black hole. This can then be used to infer properties of the black hole. Eg (Cygnus X-1, Mastroserio+19)
   - For the LIGO observations, use frequency and duration of binary merger expression$$\omega^{-8/3} \propto M_c^{5/3}t$$where $\omega$ is the gravitational wave frequency, $M_c$ is the [[Gravitational waves#Chirp mass|chirp mass]], and $t$ is the time to chirp (merger). Assuming coalescence happens at $r = 2GM/c^2$ where $M$ is total mass, the frequency at coalescence is $$\omega_c = \frac{c^3}{\sqrt{8} G M}$$so in this way we can find both $M$ and $M_c$ and combine them to obtain the individual masses. 

   **Spins**
   [[Binaries#X-ray binary|X-ray binaries]] (XRBs) are rapidly spinning. LIGO has discovered many slowly-spinning BHs with $\chi_{\rm{eff}}\simeq 0$ (the mass-weighted effective spin). Now we describe how these are measured.
   - For XRBs can use **reflection spectroscopy** which is using the shape of spectral lines emitted in the [[AGN#AGN|corona]] and reflected off the accretion disk to constraing $R_{\rm{ISCO}}$ which is related to the spin $a$.
