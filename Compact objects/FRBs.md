## FRB
"Fast radio burst". A transient radio pulse of length ranging from a fraction of a millisecond to 3 seconds, caused by some high-energy astrophysical process not yet understood. Most FRBs are extragalactic, but the first [[Galaxy examples#Milky Way|MW]] FRB was detected by the [[Observatories#CHIME|CHIME]] radio telescope in April 2020.

Theorized to come from compact-object mergers and [[Neutron stars#Magnetar|magnetars]] arising from normal core collapse [[Supernovae#Supernova|supernovae]].
