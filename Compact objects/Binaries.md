## Kepler's laws
For one object in a binary:
1. The orbit is ellipse with center of mass at one focus
2. The line joining the focus and the object sweeps out equal areas in equal time $\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\phi}$
3. $P^2\sim a^3$ where $P$ is period and $a$ is semi-major axis

**Proof**:



## Binary evolution
- stable mass transfer (to do with roche lobe and radius tradeoff)
- common envlope(?)
- dynamical formation, merging by collision (?) (for binary NS this is rare)


## Tidal migration
(Will use labels "planet" and "star" but in principle applies more widely).

When the tidal force on the planet creates a bulge and a torque that serves to reduce the semi-major axis of the orbit, especially near perihelion of highly-eccentric orbits.

**Why?**
The tidal bulges are not aligned between the two bodies (ie not along the same axis). This is because if the rotation period of the star is longer than the orbital period of the planet,

## Tidal disruption event
high-eccentricity orbit near a [[Black holes|SMBH]] disrupts object and shoots some of the material off
