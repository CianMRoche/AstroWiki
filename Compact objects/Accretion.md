## Accretion disk
Loosely, when mass is transferring from one place to another, spinning. Mass falling onto a compact object almost always involved.

**Examples**:
- [[AGN]]
- [[Definitions - The Solar System#Protoplanetary disk|Protoplanetary disks]]
- Long-duration [[GRBs#GRB|GRB]] progenitors

**Why do we form a disk?**
Start with a quasi-spherical distribution of matter like a [[Nebulae#Nebula|nebula]]. That cloud of matter starts with *some* net angular momentum about its center of mass (why? probably relates to initial conditios of universe, I dont have a good answer. If it didn't, seems like an unstable configuration anyway). Put a plane perpendicular to that net angular momentum, and that defines roughly where a disk will form later. Why?

Can be thought of in terms of the centrifugal force. Imagine a large sphere rotating (we are considering all matter at a certain distance from the center of mass). If you stand near the poles, the centrifugal force is very small, but on the equator the centrifugal force is large. Gravity wants to pull all the material to the center, but the centrifugal force resists this. Near the pole, matter can fall in much easier than at the equator, and so over time this asymmetry leads to the matter preferentially finding itself in the plane perpendicular to the original net angular momentum. Matter speeds up as it falls toward the center in order to conserve the angular momentum of its orbit. 

Retrograde spinning matter is more likely to collide, which drive their orbits toward the "average" more quickly via the exchange of orbital angular momentum and energy, like the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium in a gas. As a result, retrograde stars in the Milky Way for example are either in the galactic halo (ie not in the disk) or from recent galactic mergers that havent phase-mixed yet (not "averaged out").
