## Pulsar
**PULSA**ting **R**adio source. [[Neutron stars#Neutron stars|Neutron star]] which emits beams of radiation along the axis through its magnetic poles. This axis is misaligned with the spin axis of the neutron star so that like a lighthouse with two bulbs, one or both of the beams (if aligned fortunately) pass over Earth periodically.

**Typical parameters**: 
Same (roughly) as [[Neutron stars#Neutron stars|neutron star]] with the following additions:
- $P\sim 0.01-10\,\pu{s}$
- $\dot{P} \sim 10^{-17}-10^{-14}$ 
- Peak frequency $\sim 300\,\pu{Hz}$ which is very low [[Spectra#The electromagnetic spectrum|radio]]

- highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits EM radiation out of its magnetic poles
- [[Spectra#RadioSource|Radio source]] (galactic and extragalactic)
- Brightest at low-frequencies
- Look up "black widow pulsar"

Should know how to explain the $P$ $\dot P$ diagram

## Pulsar timing
[[Observatories#NANOGrav|NANOGrav]] does it. Use [[Neutron stars#<mark class="hltr-orange">Pulsar</mark>|pulsars]] to construct a galactic-scale interferometer, with test masses bigger than the mass of the Sun. Use many millisecond pulsars to search for nHz GW signals (low freq because they're essentially a giant GW interferometer).

Millisecond pular: 
cycled to very short periods via accretion from a companion star.

Pulsar timing array: GWs produce correlated changes in pulse arrival times. Unlike LIGO need to account for gravitational wave perturbation both at the pulsar and the Earth. (?). Oh cuz We are not detecting with some detector like LIGO on Earth, we are deteching the GW strain on Earth itself, which changes the pulse arrival times at different telescopes. Maybe? Not sure.
