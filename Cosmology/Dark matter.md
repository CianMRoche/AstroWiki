## Dark matter
Several lines of evidence suggest that there's a lot of mass in the universe that we cant see. See [[Galaxies - Questions#101|this question]] for some of those lines of evidence.

2. Cosmology
3. Gravitational Waves

**What we know about DM**:
- Particles are slow/cold
- It doesnt interact with EM in a way we've observed
- It acts like regular old matter [[Galaxy cluster examples#Bullet Cluster|bullet cluster]]
- Strongly clustered
- Stable
- Essential (necessary to explain what we've seen

$\implies$ we have already detected and "discovered" dark matter

We have also constrained its interaction cross-section and mass, thhough the possible parameter space is massive (interaction is at least as strong as grav alone, mass is less than about a solar mass, wavelength cant be more than about a galaxy size)

**What we dont know**:
- What kind of particle? elementary?
- Any non-gravitational interactions?
- Role in cosmic history?
- How does it fit into fundamental physics?

1. **Quantum sensors**: "Does dark matter interact with us nongravitationally?"
   Lab experiments can probe "heavy DM" like billiard balls, but for very light DM our detector needs to detect the whole wavefunction of the DM, so we need *quantum detectors*
   
   Dark matter also interacts with *quasiparticles* which are collective excitations of systems (think normal modes of a spring-mass system) like a plasmon (or a phonon). One finds that detectors can be more sensitive to collective modes, and importantly since they are not elementary, they are also **controllable** with adjustable sensitivity. Allows one to put constraint curves in the interaction cross-section / mass plane

2. **Cosmology**: "Structure reveals structure"
   Are there symmetries in the dark sector that influence how DM behaves in the very high-temperature early universe? If so, what are their signatures now? Yes: Imprints on [[Power spectrum#Matter power spectrum|matter power spectrum]] as a result of resonances, long scale interactions and phase transitions of DM

3. **Gravitational waves**: "If theres not other interaction at all, what can gravity alone do for us?""
   Gravity is universal, super-weak, so we'll never see a single DM particle with gravity alone (unless DM is primordial black holes).
   
   What is a system in which gravity controls all the dynamics? Merging black hole binaries (baryonic physics isnt changing much there? Is that the argument?). Different DM models have different imprint on waveform? **Is the length scale of a detectable merging BH binary sufficiently large to know anything about DM physics?** Dont we understand black holes baryonically? The class of mergers he's talking about are ones at galactic centers, where DM is strongly clustered near BHs. Pulsar timing arrays of SMBH mergers might be the ones where such a signal is found, intermediate-mass mergers wont work [[Observatories#NANOGrav|NANOGrav will do it]]. Focus is on stochastic background of GWs, not individual mergers. 


## Primordial black holes
Dark matter candidate, an ~[[Definitions - The Solar System#Asteroid|asteroid]]-sized black hole formed not by baryonic / stellar evolution means. Almost the entire parameter space for PBHs is ruled out.


## Freeze-in


## Fuzzy dark matter
Dark matter so light that i is wavelike(?), that smooths out small scales and creates interference patterns in structure.

De-Broglie wavelength (for neutrinos its $\sim 0.5\,\rm{mm}$):$$\lambda_{DB} = \frac{h}{p} \sim \frac{1}{\rm{mass}}$$
- FDM effectively smooths out smallest scale sctructure
- Scalar field with periodic potential (Taylor expands to a quadratic)
- Primordially produced by misalignment mechanism, which leads to behaving like CDM on large scales but not on small scales
- One potential solution to core-cusp problem, along with SIDM and baryonic feedback.
- Forms soliton core, a high-density region with constant central density and a sharp cutoff at $\sim \,1\pu{kpc}$ 


## Axions
Solves strong-CP problem of QCD. People also consider "axion-like particles".


## MACHOs
"Massive Compact Halo Objects". A class of dark matter candidates consisting of anything which can be described as a "lump of material we wouldn't expect to see emitting enough light to have been detected". Examples range from [[Definitions - The Solar System#Asteroid|asteroids]] to brown dwarfs, [[Black holes]], or [[Exoplanets - Questions|exoplanets]]. 

Most of the parameter space is ruled out, for example by photometric [[Lensing#Microlensing|microlensing]] experiments, as in order to explain all there extra mass we would need a LOT of MACHOs and therefore would see a lot more microlensing events. Also ruled out by existence of wide binaries, astrometric microlensing, 


## Evaporation and Heating
Source: Abdel journal club talk.

DM on celestial body scales (NSs or exoplanets etc, exo 1000:1 NS). DM can lose energy passing through a body, then get grav bound, expect small scale overdense halos around them. Then they can annihilate and heat up planet. Should see that the the temp of exoplanets increases toward galactic center (how to disentangle from temperature gradients, maybe not too bad)

Evaporation is the other direction. DM upscattering and leaving. evap mass is the lower lim of dm mass that you can have bound to your celestial body. Masses < evap mass escape, higher than evap mass are bound.
