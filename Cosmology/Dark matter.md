## Fuzzy dark matter
- FDM effectively smooths out smallest scale sctructure
- Scalar field with periodic potential (Taylor expands to a quadratic)
- Primordially produced by misalignment mechanism, which leads to behaving like CDM on large scales but not on small scales
- One potential solution to core-cusp problem, along with SIDM and baryonic feedback.
- Forms soliton core, a high-density region with constant central density and a sharp cutoff at $\sim \,1\pu{kpc}$
