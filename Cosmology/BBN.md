## BBN
"Big bang nucleosynthesis". The synthesis of light elements in the early universe  ~minutes after the big bang. Has following characteristics:
- The initial conditions (neutron–proton ratio) were set in the first second after the Big Bang, at the neutron "freeze-out" (see below). In general a "freeze out" is when the conditions (like temperature or density) change such that a certain interaction becomes very unlikely to happen. This ratio is the key parameter determining the abundances of light elements after nucleosynthesis ends
- The universe was very close to homogeneous at this time, and strongly radiation-dominated.
- The fusion of nuclei occurred between roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang; this corresponds to the temperature range when the universe was <mark class="hltr-pink">cool enough for deuterium to survive, but hot and dense enough for fusion reactions to occur at a significant rate</mark>.

**Deuterium bottleneck**
The fusion reactions are as follows, noting that they almost all involve fusing deuterium$$\begin{align}
\mathrm{p}+\mathrm{n} &\longrightarrow{ }^2 \mathrm{H}+\gamma \\
\mathrm{p}+{ }^2 \mathrm{H} &\longrightarrow{ }^3 \mathrm{He}+\gamma \\
{ }^2 \mathrm{H}+{ }^2 \mathrm{H} &\longrightarrow{ }^3 \mathrm{He}+\mathrm{n} \\
{ }^2 \mathrm{H}+{ }^2 \mathrm{H} &\longrightarrow{ }^3 \mathrm{H}+\mathrm{p} \\
{ }^3 \mathrm{He}+{ }^2 \mathrm{H} &\longrightarrow{ }^4 \mathrm{He}+\mathrm{p} \\
{ }^3 \mathrm{H}+{ }^2 \mathrm{H} &\longrightarrow{ }^4 \mathrm{He}+\mathrm{n}
\end{align}$$The binding energy of deuterium is $2.22\,\pu{MeV}$ so deuterium fusion cant begin until the universe is $\ll 2.22\,\pu{MeV}$. In this time, some neutrons can decay into protons via $\beta$-decay with a lifetime of $890\,\pu{s}$ (this helps reconcile the observed $\ce{He}$ mass fraction from BBN). This decreases the neutron to proton ratio from a predicted 0.2 to a predicted 0.15 (which more closely matches observations).

**The neutron-proton ratio**
Set by Standard Model physics before the nucleosynthesis era, essentially within the first 1-second after the Big Bang. Neutrons can react with positrons or electron neutrinos to create protons and other products in one of the following reactions: $$\begin{align}
\mathrm{n}+\mathrm{e}^{+} &\rightleftharpoons \bar{\nu}_{\mathrm{e}}+\mathrm{p} \\
\mathrm{n}+\nu_{\mathrm{e}} &\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{p}+\mathrm{e}^{-}
\end{align}$$At times much earlier than 1 sec, these reactions were fast and maintained the n/p ratio close to 1:1. As the temperature dropped, the equilibrium shifted in favour of protons due to their slightly lower mass, and the n/p ratio smoothly decreased. These reactions continued until the decreasing temperature and density caused the reactions to become too slow, which occurred at about T = 0.7 MeV (time around 1 second) and is called the <mark class="hltr-pink">freeze out</mark> temperature. At freeze out, the neutron–proton ratio was about 1/6. However, free neutrons are unstable with a mean life of 880 sec; some neutrons decayed in the next few minutes before fusing into any nucleus, so the ratio of total neutrons to protons after nucleosynthesis ends is about 1/7.
