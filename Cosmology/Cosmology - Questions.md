**Summarize the state of the experimental field of 21cm cosmology and what it hopes to accomplish.**

See [[Spectra#21cm line|21cm line]] for explanation of line physics. 

What is the use of this line in studying cosmology? 
- Can use this transition to map the fraction of Hydrogen which is neutral over cosmic time, which tells us about the [[Reionization#Epoch of reionization|epoch of reionization]]. ![[neutral_hydrogen.png|500]]
- As [[CMB#CMB|CMB]] photons pass through a neutral hydrogen region, what we observe (ask Haochen)

What experiments can do this?
- [[Observatories#CHIME|CHIME]]. Also can measure [[BAO#BAO|BAO]] signal with these measurements
- [[Observatories#HERA|HERA]]. Can allow us to study first stars and epoch of reionization. Will place limits on 21cm power spectrum and thus ou understanding of how ionized bubbled form and evolve. More robust against astrophysical foreground, but still need accurate foreground models in all cases to see any signal at all
- [[Observatories#MWA|MWA]] and [[Observatories#SKA|SKA]] similar.
