## LCDM

**tracy talk**
Bevy. tl;dr are all the [[Observatories#JWST]] high-redshift galaxies consistent with LCDM? If we take all the baryons in these galaxies, what fraction of the baryons at that redshift are in those galaxies? They find that its almost all of it (Boylan-Kolchin). However the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies are not in tension.
