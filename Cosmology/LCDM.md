## LCDM
"Lambda Cold Dark Matter". Also referred to as the "standard model of cosmology" because it is the simplest model that reproduces reasonably well the following observations:
- The existence and structure of the [[CMB]]
- The large-scale structure in the distribution of [[Galaxies]]
- The observed abundances of hydrogen (including deuterium), helium, and lithium (see [[BBN]])
- The accelerating expansion of the universe observed in the light from distant galaxies and [[Supernovae]]

Model is an [[FLRW]] universe with a cosmological constant "$\Lambda$" which drives acceleration of expansion and a significant cold [[Dark matter]] component, which has the properties of:
- non-baryonic: 
   It consists of matter other than protons and neutrons (and electrons, by convention, although electrons are not baryons).
- cold: 
   Its velocity is far less than the speed of light at the epoch of radiationâ€“matter equality (thus neutrinos are excluded, being non-baryonic but not cold).
- dissipationless: 
   It cannot cool by radiating photons.
- collisionless: 
   The dark matter particles interact with each other and other particles only through gravity and possibly the weak force.

Despite successes, there does exist a number of tensions between LCDM and observations, and the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model) that I've been stealing content from does a good job of reviewing these.
