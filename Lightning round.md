## 164. What kind of objects would you guess the following were?
- [[Catalogs#Henry Draper|HD]] 128220 - Its a [[Stellar classes#Subdwarf O star|Subdwarf O star]] but thats not important 
- [[Catalogs#Abell|Abell]] 426 - Otherwise known as the [[Galaxy cluster examples#Perseus cluster|Perseus cluster]] 
- QSO 1013+277 - A [[AGN#Quasar|quasar]] (from "quasi stellar object")
- $\alpha$ Crucis - brightest star in "Crux" constellation, thus given "$\alpha$"
- [[Catalogs#Mrk|Mrk]] 509 - a galaxy
- [[Catalogs#3C|3C]] 234 - a radio-loud [[AGN#Quasar|quasar]]
- [[Catalogs#NGC|NGC]] 2808 - could be one of a few things, turns out to be [[Clustering#Globular Cluster|globular cluster]]
- [[Catalogs#PSR|PSR]] 0950+08 - [[Pulsars#Pulsar|pulsar]]
- [[Catalogs#BD|BD]] +$61^\circ 1211$ - star
- $\beta$ Pictoris b - First planet discovered around second brightest star in pictoris constellation (we dont use a because a is the star apparently, but we dont call it a...)

**What are the strongest spectral lines seen in each of the following: Integrated light from a typical**

**(i) galaxy**
- Strong continuum from combined [[Blackbody radiation#Blackbody radiation|blackbody]] radiation from many stars
- In elliptical [[Galaxies#Galaxy|galaxies]], see 
	- Little star formation $\implies$ no strong emission lines
	- Metal absorption lines like $\ce{Ca,K,Mg}$
- In spiral galaxies, see
	- Ongoing star formation ionizes the gas, so see emission lines
	- Most prominent are [[Spectra#H-alpha|H-alpha]] and $\ce{O\,III}$ 

**(ii) quasar**
Ionizing radiation from the [[AGN#Quasar|quasar]] 
- More energy than stellar ionization, so see lines of higher ionization levels
- Strongest lines [[Spectra#Lyman-alpha forest|Lyman-alpha]] and ionized ~low elements on periodic table like $\ce{C\,IV}$ and $\ce{OIII}$ 
- Also see balmer lines, and we can use line ratios to determine the ionizing source

**(iii) 100 km/s interstellar shockwave**
Produced by [[Supernovae#Supernova|supernovae]] (see [[Compact objects - Questions#51|this question]]). What is gas temp at this speed? $$E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{3}{2}kT \implies T \simeq 35\,\pu{eV} > \chi_{\ce{He}}\simeq 25\,\pu{eV}$$so we can ionize helium, and we see strong lines.

**(iv) giant molecular cloud?**
A [[Star formation#Molecular cloud|molecular cloud]] is cold ($T\simeq 10$s of $\pu{K}$) so no ionization, instead see rotational and vibrational molecule transitions. Strongest lines from $\ce{CO}$. Theres only 1 or those for every $10^4\,\ce{H_2}$, but unfortunately $\ce{H_2}$ is [[Spectra#Molecular hydrogen|symmetric]] so no rotational modes, and lightweight so vibrational modes hard to observe. Thus we use $\ce{CO}$ as a tracer.

How far away are the following objects? How large and how massive are they?

1. [[The Sun]]
2. The Orion [[Nebulae|nebula]]
3. M13 - a [[Clustering#Globular Cluster|globular cluster]] orbiting [[AGN examples#Sagittarius A|Sag A]] (ie at the center of the [[Milky Way]])
4. [[Galaxy examples#M31|M31]]  
5. [[Galaxy cluster examples#Virgo Cluster|Virgo Cluster]] 
6. [[Galaxy cluster examples#Coma cluster|Coma Cluster]]

**What are the brightest extra-solar-system sources at the following wavelengths. Which, if any, are isotropic on the sky?**

You will note that below
- "isotropic" correlates strongly with "extragalactic"
- [[AGN]] are a powerful isotropic source
- See also [[Bonus Questions#Observing the EM spectrum|Observing EM spectrum]] for what telescopes could see these things in principle.
| Band         | Isotropic | Anisotropic |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| radio        |[[Galaxies#Radio galaxy\|Radio galaxies]], [[FRBs]] (less bright)| Cas A (picture below) and other [[Magnetobremsstrahlung#Synchrotron radiation\|Synchrotron]] from [[Supernovae#Supernova\|SN]] remnants|
| mm           |  [[CMB]] and [[AGN]]        |             |
| MIR          |[[Galaxies#Starburst galaxy\|Starburst galaxies]]|[[Dust]], and cool stars|
| optical      | [[Galaxies]], [[AGN]]|      Stars       |
| UV          |[[AGN#Quasar\|Quasars]]| Hot stars (eg [[Spectra#Harvard Spectral Classification\|O-type]]) and hot [[Stellar classes#White dwarf\|WDs]] |
| X-ray        |[[AGN]]|[[Binaries#X-ray binary\|XRBs]], [[Supernovae#Supernova\|SNe]] remnants, [[Galaxy clusters#Galaxy cluster\|galaxy clusters]](?)|
| $\gamma$-ray |[[GRBs]], [[AGN]]|[[Binaries#X-ray binary\|XRBs]], and the Crab [[Nebulae#Pulsar wind nebula\|pulsar wind nebula]] (brightest non-transient)|

Note: brightest radio source in a given constellation is labelled "A" (eg [[AGN examples#Sagittarius A|Sag A*]]) as with Cas A (pictured below), and X-ray sources typically get something like "X1" etc.
