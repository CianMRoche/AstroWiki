# AstroWiki
Notes to supplement study for the MIT astrophysics division oral qualification exam

### Requirements
Install the markdown note-taking application [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and you can open the AstroWiki folder as a "vault" with complementary connected graph view.

To edit, it may also be good to install the obsidian plugin [Highlightr](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin) from within the obsidian settings menu (Settings > Community Plugins > Browse > Highlightr, then ensure its enabled.)
