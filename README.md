# AstroWiki
Notes to supplement study for the MIT astrophysics division oral qualification exam. Press the "control" key (or maybe command on mac) when hovering over an internal link in the notes to display the linked note without switching to it.

### Requirements
Install the markdown note-taking application [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and you can open the AstroWiki folder as a "vault" with complementary connected graph view.

To edit, it may also be good to install the obsidian plugin [Highlightr](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin) from within the obsidian settings menu (Settings > Community Plugins > Browse > Highlightr, then ensure its enabled.) though this comes packaged by default with this repo.
