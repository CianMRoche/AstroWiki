(some of these might not really be "mnemonics" but close enough)

- To measure the mass of a SMBH: use the H$\beta$ lag to tell if it's a H(uh) $\beta$(ig boy)

- Oh Be A Fine Goat Kick Me (for [[Spectra#Harvard Spectral Classification|spectral classes]])

- Electron? eLEPTON

- My Very Elegant Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas (for the [[The Solar System - Questions|solar system]])

- HHeLiBeBCNOF (pronounced 'heeliebeb kenoff') to remember the first nine chemical elements

- CNO...NOt Finished !! CNO again (to remember the CNO two-branch cyclic diagram [[cno_panels.png|CNO panels]]). Helium nucleus emitted on the bottom left and top right, carbon 12 on bottom left, essentially fixes the whole diagram.

- Helps to not mess up the virial theorem signs: The virial theorem is a "TUTU"  (from 2 and TU and the RHS is the top-down view of a tutu) $$2T + U = 0$$![[virial_theorem.png|200]]

- [[Velocity dispersion#Tully-Fisher relation|Tully-Fisher]] is for spirals because whirlpools are in the ocean where fish live üêü
  De Vaucouleurs profile is for ellipticals because ellipticals are old and haughty (puffed up). And quarters were invented in the past so thats why its 4. 

- To remember the scaling relations for overdensities $\delta$ and scale factors $a$ with time $t$ in radiation and matter dominated epochs (of an [[FLRW]] universe), for some reason I find it easy to remember the exponents this way (radiation happens first in the universe)
  - Rad-dom: $\delta \propto a^2 \propto t^1$            (<mark class="hltr-pink">21</mark>, like the savage, or the drinking age in the US)
  - Matter-dom: $\delta \propto a^1 \propto t^{2/3}$     (<mark class="hltr-pink">123</mark>, like the first 3 numbers)
  So I guess just remember 21 and 123.

- To remember whether $\Omega_k$ positive or negative means an open or closed universe in the context of the [[FLRW]] metric, just remember that a sphere is closed because I'm trapped inside it, and I have very **negative** feelings about this trapping (so $\Omega_k < 0$ is **closed**). We talk about $\Omega_k$ more than $k$, but just remember that they have a minus sign relative to one another so a negative $\Omega_k$ means a positive $k$ and vice versa.

- To remember [[Binaries#Kepler's laws|Keplers third]] just remember "aw good morning 321" $$a^3 \omega^2 = GM$$
